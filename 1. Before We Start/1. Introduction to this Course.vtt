00:00.750 --> 00:06.320
Hello and welcome to this new course this is the second part and the other ones are bit of the VM where

00:06.320 --> 00:13.230
Visby of course this course necessary to be already have in it and completed the preview course Part

00:13.230 --> 00:20.250
Number one that's covered our beginners future of VM were visited but we'll let you build your own VM

00:20.250 --> 00:23.520
we're up and start configure and manage it.

00:23.550 --> 00:30.170
I was at the center server deploy and manage Vetri and machine network and storage.

00:30.360 --> 00:37.080
Then you can start with this new cores that were going to help you to muster all other features of the

00:37.080 --> 00:38.990
VMware Wickwire 6.5.

00:39.330 --> 00:45.720
If you remember from the preview we've world our home lab we create our central server and we practice

00:45.780 --> 00:53.170
odd VM where fut. that's what we do look on stodge then we finish the course by up for stiction about

00:53.250 --> 00:59.690
different external monsters available in VM where Vitry that the Santer environments know in discussions

00:59.760 --> 01:06.090
will go into the next level and into other parts of the futures that we can't do it without having an

01:06.150 --> 01:10.760
external storage or to be more specific as shedded stodge.

01:10.860 --> 01:18.680
So in discourse Arab world my home lab after the 60 day trial expired so we can practice more with another

01:18.690 --> 01:21.140
trial version without any problem.

01:21.300 --> 01:27.920
By following this course you will learn how to configure and manage to distribute to scheduling dress

01:27.950 --> 01:29.280
and the.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.100
The height of ability each a default Rylands empty resource pool.

01:35.110 --> 01:40.320
Divvy up the host provide the updates manager and the more and the more.

01:40.620 --> 01:44.400
Hey it's been I am a system and network administrator.

01:44.400 --> 01:50.490
I graduated from as he did of Applied Technology in 2008 and I start managing Vitruvian environment

01:50.520 --> 01:53.360
using VM technology from 2000 mine.

01:53.370 --> 01:59.660
I keep learning every day and I succeed to muster all the technical futures and tools of VM where does

01:59.670 --> 02:02.010
fit troubled of course.

02:02.030 --> 02:06.830
Maybe you will feel that my accent is a little stronger because English is my third language.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.700
As you know everyone has an accent.

02:09.740 --> 02:16.390
The fact that we think the way we speak is normal is the first clue that empathy is quite difficult.

02:16.400 --> 02:23.780
You might also notice how easy it is to NOT ICE people who are much worse at driving than you are but

02:23.930 --> 02:28.920
that you almost never recognize someone who's driving better than you are.

02:29.150 --> 02:33.740
So let's start discovering VM where our future together in the next lectures.
