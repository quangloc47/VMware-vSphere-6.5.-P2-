00:00.630 --> 00:01.360
Blogging.

00:01.620 --> 00:06.800
So when we reverts back to the previous snapshot snapshots of it.

00:06.810 --> 00:11.560
But if we check another virtual machine that does not have any it's not what you see you are here.

00:11.820 --> 00:17.180
But this one that's have not put you are here and we have a preview snapshot.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.530
What's happened here.

00:18.660 --> 00:28.250
When we go back to the original disk when we all revert back to the States we don't change the original

00:28.260 --> 00:36.420
disk from read only to read to write what we how we form made do they have to vindicate the one that

00:36.520 --> 00:38.650
is created with the snapshot.

00:38.730 --> 00:46.050
We delete all the data that's dealt out via decay and we use the original data from original disk.

00:46.300 --> 00:53.160
I mean we back to the State of the original disk or the virtual machine before the statute but we still

00:53.370 --> 00:55.330
keep the snapshot.

00:55.330 --> 00:58.640
Save it for another task.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.810
That's me in this situation.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.680
If we want to integrate.

01:02.770 --> 01:08.390
No VM decie with original decie and make do origin of the Indic.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.040
All right.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.490
And Rick we need to delete our Snapshot.

01:12.590 --> 01:13.230
Let's.

01:13.410 --> 01:19.600
We are here but we are going to deliver this snapshot that exist in a specific time.

01:19.860 --> 01:23.520
But of course in our situation we're not going to do it right.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.590
No we'll do it later.

01:25.590 --> 01:29.030
So for example we want to create more than once natural.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.830
So we simply can.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.150
Of course let's make some.

01:32.170 --> 01:44.610
It's an example we're going to create a new file call it like that's going to come up and what that's

01:44.610 --> 01:44.850
mean.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.660
This is the snapshot number one.

01:46.740 --> 01:51.980
Then we go and create snapshot take a snapshot.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.470
Of course we chose the snapshot of visual memory.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.390
OK.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.130
It would take a little time to do it.

02:02.490 --> 02:08.370
Then of course in that time you can create anything but any change that happened after taking the snapshot

02:08.670 --> 02:15.420
we'll be seeing it in the new disk and not in the original one.

02:15.710 --> 02:19.180
So in that time we can use the virtual machine without any problem.

02:22.250 --> 02:26.610
Of course that's consume the resource of my laptop.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.630
Give me some little time

02:34.050 --> 02:37.590
ahead is it creates on your virtual machine snapshot.

02:37.790 --> 02:42.740
So you see right here we have a snapshot inside us nachos and you are here.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.210
That's when you are in this snapshot.

02:45.210 --> 02:52.390
If we are back right there or try to create a new folder on your block in one of the two.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.300
OK.

02:55.480 --> 03:04.130
So you know it's not so tough on you'll find and can delta-V and decie but we try to go to the stars

03:04.640 --> 03:07.720
like that because of this line.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.140
Try to take it Condon's

03:11.910 --> 03:15.080
we'll see another VM decie created.

03:15.150 --> 03:22.650
If you remember the second one to add up to 30 to V.M. Dickie delta-V and Dickie can be created that's

03:22.650 --> 03:25.110
me up to 32.

03:25.230 --> 03:30.560
Snapshot can be ticket for ish virtual machine that is it's

03:33.350 --> 03:41.850
so hard is it if we check how the Windows XP 0 4 0 0 0 number this is the VM decie number for the second

03:41.940 --> 03:43.030
snapshot.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.240
And where is it.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.430
The VM Dickie's 0 0 0 what do snapshot number one.

03:47.430 --> 03:53.010
So we have this natural number one Delta disk then the natural number thought that that is.

03:53.220 --> 03:59.660
They do memory the data of the memory if you remember when we clone this virtual machine.

03:59.790 --> 04:04.620
I have about two hundred sixteen gigabytes consumed.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.530
So how does it.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.320
Snapshot memory.

04:07.350 --> 04:14.880
It saves the data about the memory in this fight that's consume two hundred sixteen megabytes and then

04:15.030 --> 04:18.220
Dicky that saved the charge of only nineteen megabytes.

04:18.330 --> 04:24.810
The second one that save are modified with some idiot didn't have 24 megabytes and the same size of

04:24.810 --> 04:25.400
the memory.

04:25.410 --> 04:30.230
It's about the same because all the loading fight is the same.

04:30.240 --> 04:38.130
So if we create a snapshot we have our modern the that's callid 0 0 0 3 and so on and so on until 30

04:38.370 --> 04:45.830
to VM decie that can't support our VM Where is fair 6.5 snapshot.

04:46.470 --> 04:53.850
Of course between machine work perfectly then if you box to do virtual machine writer Chicot's snapshot

04:53.850 --> 04:57.540
you will find that you are hurt when you create a snapshot.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.210
The same will be happening.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.620
So take a snapshot.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.890
Then you give it one example treat like that.

05:05.090 --> 05:08.050
OK it will save a change.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.180
Of course we didn't.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.540
Trees are fine right here but just to see the difference.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.110
Not a lot that we can use it

05:17.880 --> 05:24.330
and to get an idea about how we can revert back to a different snapshot.

05:24.780 --> 05:30.160
So the process of creating a snapshot will save the rain forest.

05:30.170 --> 05:41.200
If you go back to the data store you will find a new file will be created when the process completes.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.550
So this is the information about the snapshot.

05:43.690 --> 05:50.010
The memory of the snapshot and do car driver of the snapshot then does not show up number one.

05:50.030 --> 05:55.060
How does the memory the configuration and do without the Indic.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.470
So the snapshot is complete.

05:56.480 --> 06:04.760
If we try to refresh this one you will see the new VM decie 0 0 3 added successfully in this folder

06:04.760 --> 06:06.070
of the virtual machine.

06:10.310 --> 06:12.340
OK let's give it a little time.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.490
We back right here.

06:13.530 --> 06:15.340
Try to look at this one again.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.730
So how does it do this.

06:19.810 --> 06:30.480
I'll reveal decie 0 0 0 to reduce snapshot memory number 3 and snapshot config 0 3 so it will keep adding

06:30.530 --> 06:31.710
a very hard disk.

06:31.770 --> 06:32.410
When we are there.

06:32.430 --> 06:38.660
Do you see the name I changed to number 3 because we give it a name number 3 and does not know what

06:38.720 --> 06:40.710
to do snapshot number 1.
