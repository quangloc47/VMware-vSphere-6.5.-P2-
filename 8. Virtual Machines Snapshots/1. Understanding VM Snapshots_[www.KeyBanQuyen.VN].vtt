00:01.100 --> 00:08.000
Hello and welcome in this new section that we're going to cover our new future of the VM where that's

00:08.150 --> 00:10.000
it is not short.

00:10.550 --> 00:19.320
So it's not true is a very simple future of the word that we use it for a specific reason.

00:19.340 --> 00:23.490
So the first what is a VM snapshot.

00:23.510 --> 00:32.510
So it's not it's a very simple future that will lead us to get our copy of the virtual machine in a

00:32.510 --> 00:40.780
specific time and use it for adding some updates or any editing.

00:40.940 --> 00:48.980
If something wrong we can back to the preview version of the machine before editing or adding some updates

00:49.010 --> 00:50.300
on the machine.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.130
It's like a restoration system.

00:53.180 --> 01:00.920
Any Windows operating system you use when you have for example a problem in your operating system and

01:00.920 --> 01:01.930
try to fix it.

01:01.940 --> 01:05.980
One of the options available is to restore the Windows Update view date.

01:06.050 --> 01:11.400
For example when you start using your machine today you find that you have a problem today after Einstein

01:11.440 --> 01:18.230
and a specific application you go to do start accesory and you have an option that's called restoration

01:18.350 --> 01:19.130
of the system.

01:19.160 --> 01:24.160
You check the available restore date available in the system.

01:24.160 --> 01:32.210
For example you chose to restore the machine a week ago or two days ago and then you chose that specific

01:32.210 --> 01:39.050
date and start the restoration of the operating system and your machine back to the preview state before

01:39.050 --> 01:41.010
the problem happen.

01:41.030 --> 01:49.010
So the same idea where we the virtual machine VM where we use the snap shot.

01:49.460 --> 01:58.700
So we have our virtual machine that's a virtual machine connected to our VM dequeue find the Virtual

01:58.700 --> 02:05.020
Hard Disk of this digital machine that vindictive file have all the data of this between machine like

02:05.020 --> 02:13.030
to operating system to application DocI mom fight etc. are the things that you create drag this virtual

02:13.080 --> 02:15.680
machine sit in our VM.

02:15.680 --> 02:26.420
Did you find the original VM DK fine so when we want to use a snapshot of this virtual machine we do

02:26.420 --> 02:26.560
it.

02:26.570 --> 02:27.730
Abdula bit of do.

02:27.860 --> 02:33.330
VM dignifies So the snapshots work at the level of VM dequeue fine.

02:33.470 --> 02:39.230
Does not have any relation about the brain of the virtual machine like to see you do run.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.700
No we talk about storage.

02:41.990 --> 02:52.460
So in a specific time for example a specific time or date or a moment you run our Snapshot to this virtual

02:52.460 --> 02:53.090
machine.

02:54.940 --> 03:05.070
And then you start and start any application after that snapshot or after that specific date to make

03:05.160 --> 03:06.700
any changes that you want.

03:06.780 --> 03:11.430
So what's happened when you start a snapshot in a virtual machine.

03:11.430 --> 03:15.910
So in this example this virtual machine connected to this VM Dick file.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.440
And this is your machine.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.610
Right and right in this theme dignified in the specific time zone.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.500
This moment right.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.030
No.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.650
You chose to run a snapshot to this virtual machine.

03:27.670 --> 03:37.790
What's this virtual machine do is it creates a new VM define that they top of the dick you find it's

03:37.800 --> 03:44.520
a small disk a smug virtual disk like this one but it's a new one that is empty.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.600
Does not have any information yet.

03:47.190 --> 03:49.660
And freeze this one.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.360
It's like this mushy stop.

03:52.410 --> 03:58.170
Read and write from this does it start read and read from the new one.

03:58.170 --> 04:02.850
But the new one still connected to do our original one.

04:02.850 --> 04:09.660
So we have original VM VM decie fine disk that I fight with only when we run the snapshot.

04:09.660 --> 04:17.340
This this could become only phone read only the virtual machine contact this VM could find for read

04:17.490 --> 04:24.980
only then when any change happens with this virtual machine it's it in the new VM dequeue file that's

04:24.990 --> 04:25.700
got it.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.410
VM did you find this got up at 5.

04:28.430 --> 04:29.270
Read and write.

04:29.280 --> 04:37.840
So the new VM Dickie file is available for write and read for any change in the block.

04:38.550 --> 04:42.370
So to get our big idea right here that's mean.

04:42.400 --> 04:49.800
Use that is this virtual machine and you are as an administrator before doing the snapshot it it's in

04:49.800 --> 04:52.270
Hopman from the user inside this machine.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.750
It saves it in this VM you're fine.

04:55.050 --> 05:00.320
When you run a snapshot to dissipate your machine you freeze this VM.

05:00.330 --> 05:07.360
Dick if I mean you close any change with this one it's become for real only and you use that when you

05:07.370 --> 05:14.370
click save for a specific file or a document or an excel file or anything that he do when individual

05:14.420 --> 05:16.680
machine and chose to save.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.320
That's fine.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.470
It's saved in this new VM.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.430
Dicky again when do you try to load.

05:23.490 --> 05:32.840
Ah another fine he loaded from this one a loader Dokument or a another excel file or are there bays

05:32.910 --> 05:34.630
or a power plant.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.860
It's so low the fire alarm does this.

05:37.920 --> 05:43.500
In the dream or derivates your machine he mixed it in there when he tried to save it you automatically

05:43.500 --> 05:45.030
see it in New York.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.980
Then you're fine.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.000
So this is our Snapshot.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.160
How it's work so change.

05:51.230 --> 05:54.030
BLOCK copied when snapshot is deleted.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.150
We're going to see this option later.

05:57.150 --> 06:06.150
So this is the idea when you run a snapshot do VM work periods on your virtual VM Dictaphone to save

06:06.240 --> 06:09.120
any change happen after that specific date.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.890
That moment when you're chose to take a snapshot this is a specific date.

06:13.950 --> 06:18.420
Any change after that date will save into your VM dignified.
