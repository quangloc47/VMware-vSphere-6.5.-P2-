WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:06.670
When we go back to the virtual machine and we click on these undergraduates should not we have reverts

00:06.680 --> 00:09.520
back to the latest snapshots.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.790
These is become available.

00:12.050 --> 00:18.110
So when we click on the video machine we got to do snapshots this tape right hand you see that we have

00:18.560 --> 00:21.440
two option right where you are here.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.450
That's me.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.360
You are no running division machine at this.

00:25.390 --> 00:29.190
In and the original snapshot is where you get.

00:29.260 --> 00:36.280
I voted vamp's not show the time test of the snapshot the description the time created.

00:36.360 --> 00:44.140
This uses some information to console how it will look when you take a snapshot.

00:44.180 --> 00:50.120
If we click on this one this one only have a disk usage because it's still using the same information

00:50.120 --> 00:59.750
from the original one and only the disk users don't want consume about two hundred seventy five megabyte.

00:59.760 --> 01:10.680
So if we try to for example close this one and try to create a new one like that for example there's

01:11.640 --> 01:17.520
two reasons and we try to make some editing inside this one and see if it's

01:21.140 --> 01:23.440
it's say.

01:23.810 --> 01:24.840
OK.

01:25.090 --> 01:27.890
So no we have the situation on this virtual machine.

01:27.950 --> 01:28.490
I'll.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.160
Close it.

01:29.160 --> 01:34.490
We have to fight and we mix onchange inside to fight.

01:34.630 --> 01:42.130
If we try to revert back to the one right hand that's when you are right there you have to find it.

01:42.130 --> 01:49.750
In this one of course if we make any change in this one for example copy some new fight it's the size

01:49.750 --> 01:52.050
right here will be changed for the day after this.

01:52.330 --> 02:01.440
And when we go to do that I start like that and we try to check the content of this data start to check

02:01.450 --> 02:06.230
do file of deals that VM Dicky.

02:06.280 --> 02:13.060
So we work on the Windows XP and before we go to Windows XP.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.630
Number four what is it.

02:14.650 --> 02:20.300
And try to get to available fine in this Vetri or machine.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.230
So how does it differ in spite of this virtual machine.

02:23.410 --> 02:31.360
If we try to check them Dekhi but as a VM dickhead is it to Windows XP 0 4.

02:31.570 --> 02:39.790
VM Dekhi the size of this game is ajuga right because we carried his dream machine with 8 bytes of Stosh

02:40.360 --> 02:46.790
and the new one that's got it the same name when XP 0 4 0 0 0 0 1.

02:46.990 --> 02:51.540
VM decie This is the destock disk that creates it.

02:51.640 --> 02:58.640
We do snapshot it consume about 23 megabytes of the Stosh.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.890
So this is fine.

03:01.450 --> 03:07.540
Or the top parotid file that use throw to snapshot snapshot exist in this file.

03:07.540 --> 03:11.470
Also we have some information about the snapshot this one snapshot one.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.660
Also when you create another snapshot will be it's natural to natural trees and so on and so on.

03:16.960 --> 03:23.350
So if you back to the original between Mashi And of course after creating some file with making some

03:23.410 --> 03:31.240
it did this one have a new line created like that and does one have some new update to create this file

03:31.270 --> 03:31.920
writer.

03:32.260 --> 03:38.650
And we see it also if we try to delete for example or find that already exist.

03:38.650 --> 03:41.590
Let's make it to see a real example.

03:41.670 --> 03:44.410
For example the picture of inable I turn

03:51.770 --> 03:57.350
so we have for in Wash we try to delete them from this machine for any reason.

03:59.380 --> 04:06.090
What you want but I use a delete system files from the machine and does machine start getting problem

04:06.450 --> 04:08.900
in running for your company.

04:09.120 --> 04:16.370
So for that you stay true back to a snapshot you click on this one you got a snapshot.

04:16.590 --> 04:21.150
And in this time you'll change revert to the latest snapshot.

04:21.150 --> 04:26.350
So when you click on that current state of the virtual machine will be lost only it is so read in a

04:26.350 --> 04:26.990
snapshot.

04:27.050 --> 04:34.150
Robert latticed most recent snapshot just point this virtual machine when reverting to selected snapshot.

04:34.440 --> 04:40.130
And what the situation does we have right here if our users keep using this virtual machine and for

04:40.130 --> 04:48.540
example try to tape on your data in a specific find for example hate tape right here are the name of

04:48.600 --> 04:56.880
the user or the client and so on when you run our snapshot of course all that data will be lost and

04:56.970 --> 05:00.850
any data created by the user in that specific time.

05:00.970 --> 05:08.100
We're not going to see that in any situation in the new data or in our preview of that.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.800
So there's options to support this with your machine when revetting to do still act natural does mean

05:13.800 --> 05:19.560
will you support this with your machine from in years or do you use it until complaints do revert back

05:19.560 --> 05:23.660
to the original disk then it will be back to the live.

05:23.660 --> 05:24.730
Do we use it.

05:24.810 --> 05:28.040
Of course we'll leave it like that on this one.

05:28.050 --> 05:28.390
Click.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.040
Yes.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.130
So the virtual machine revert to the current not.

05:33.370 --> 05:37.180
Of course this washing machine will be disconnected because it will just on that

05:42.180 --> 05:49.400
is that it will take time revert to the current snapshot task revert to current snapshot.

05:49.530 --> 05:50.220
OK.

05:51.780 --> 05:56.100
Loxton a Samadi.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.750
This one is out of service for a moment.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.650
That is it so rare to do.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.860
Couldn't not show it.

06:03.890 --> 06:10.330
If we go back and refresh the page you'll see that it will back to the previous one because we saved

06:10.330 --> 06:12.470
the reign of this virtual machine.

06:12.470 --> 06:16.760
So where is this if you remember this folder was opened before taking a snapshot.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.470
We make a snapshot.

06:18.620 --> 06:24.510
It's created without 7:8 the folder that exists right here is related.

06:24.740 --> 06:31.580
If we check the picture in this place it will back to the original want my picture

06:35.290 --> 06:37.220
shown to demolish.

06:37.540 --> 06:41.090
I mean the picture available how does it do for pictures.

06:41.090 --> 06:43.510
Back to the original place.

06:43.580 --> 06:48.600
And if we try to click on this one he will ask you do you want to save the change.

06:48.770 --> 06:53.350
Because when we take a snapshot this change was not because if we chose.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.760
No it will be delayed.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.990
The last line that we added.

06:57.430 --> 07:04.300
How does it do last Lambert-St of it's deleted material.

07:04.610 --> 07:05.900
So we're back to this one.

07:05.900 --> 07:10.610
If we take a snapshot we'll not found any is not true to our hair.

07:10.610 --> 07:11.340
That's mean.

07:11.450 --> 07:17.010
You are in the original snapshot and it it's you make it's connected to this one.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.990
So this is our life example of our power over your machine.

07:20.990 --> 07:27.730
Of course if we were back to the part of us we have a snapshot we can revert back to the original one.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.360
But in this situation we didn't make any chance to so.

07:31.370 --> 07:35.060
One so it's the same and we don't need to do it.

07:35.090 --> 07:40.270
So next we'll make some other this abroad scenario and discover them together and.
