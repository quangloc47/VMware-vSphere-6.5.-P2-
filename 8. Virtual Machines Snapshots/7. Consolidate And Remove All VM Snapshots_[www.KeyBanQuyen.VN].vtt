00:01.260 --> 00:01.950
Blogging.

00:02.110 --> 00:04.290
So let's try to accomplish.

00:04.290 --> 00:06.110
Do snapshot that's mean.

00:06.370 --> 00:13.600
We get our a good configuration and as a virtual machine then we want to delete all the available snapshot.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.450
So of course we got to do snapshots.

00:15.700 --> 00:19.570
So this option management snapshot tools take us to this tape right.

00:19.590 --> 00:20.660
It is the same.

00:21.130 --> 00:22.760
No we are in the snapshot.

00:22.770 --> 00:26.000
Number three that's mean editing that exists right.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.980
No we want to finish it.

00:28.040 --> 00:33.210
Naturally we want to keep the file number one and number two the application number one and number two

00:33.220 --> 00:35.270
all work perfectly without any problem.

00:35.740 --> 00:40.760
So we simply click on the virtual machine snapshot.

00:40.970 --> 00:47.470
And in this time we're not going to chose revert to the latest snapshot or we can create.

00:47.470 --> 00:48.960
Click on this display right here.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.710
That's munity exist in this one.

00:51.770 --> 00:56.120
Of course we have option to delete the snapshot or this one.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.310
Let's do it.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.740
Firstly what is on that snapshot you can edit it if you want to change the name of it.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.070
It's not part.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.690
No but you can't delete a specific snapshot for any reason.

01:08.690 --> 01:15.470
For example you have to not show that work particularly for you and this snapshot already exists or

01:15.500 --> 01:19.040
you don't need it you simply click on the X right there.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.770
Are you sure you want to delete snapshot.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.640
That's called snapshot talk.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.420
There are two glitches.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.190
So the fight of this one will be deleted without any problem.

01:29.210 --> 01:36.880
The MoVida snapshot that's Galut not trot zero to from the disk so head as it's deleted without any

01:36.880 --> 01:37.560
problem.

01:37.810 --> 01:44.860
Then of course we are writing out the option right here is integration about this one.

01:44.950 --> 01:51.280
If we click action revert it did not route or delete Aldo's natural when we chose dilates others not

01:51.340 --> 01:52.610
to will delete snapchat.

01:52.620 --> 01:58.800
Number three the snapshot number to the snapshot number one Adwan keep the data that exists when you're

01:58.890 --> 01:59.520
out here.

01:59.530 --> 02:05.940
That's mean in it it's happened after taking the truck number three will be still available and service

02:06.030 --> 02:07.850
for the machine.

02:08.040 --> 02:14.510
So for example head we click on your line of

02:18.390 --> 02:23.360
config Saudi like that's

02:26.410 --> 02:30.420
me mean we make the final configuration on this machine and it works perfectly.

02:30.630 --> 02:37.260
So if we're back to this one and click on this machine snapshot the late Aldo's not shook.

02:37.410 --> 02:46.380
No we are going to use the original disk as our men disk for read and write.

02:46.500 --> 02:54.340
So when we are right that doesn't mean we stay right where we work all to the level of the disk delta-V

02:54.490 --> 02:57.000
in a tree when we delete.

02:57.030 --> 03:04.740
How does NOT produce it will delete all the Delta disk after consolidates all do change from the disk

03:04.800 --> 03:07.480
in the original disk.

03:07.500 --> 03:16.340
So let's try it not Schult the lets us not build this will consolidate and remove as much load for this

03:16.340 --> 03:20.800
virtual machine does not will be consolidated to a single disk.

03:20.820 --> 03:21.980
Do you want to continue.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.660
Yes.

03:23.670 --> 03:27.880
Does it take a little time more than taking us.

03:28.020 --> 03:33.530
Because it is information about how much is natural to you have more a snapshot you have more faith

03:33.690 --> 03:41.310
in text because the latest one would have big size of the snapshot because it will take a chance on

03:41.310 --> 03:41.880
this one.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.010
And civets on this one.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.210
Then all the change in this they'll that this.

03:47.250 --> 03:52.470
Copy them and consolidate this one and so on and so injured original ideas.

03:52.470 --> 03:55.500
So you are here without having any data.

03:55.770 --> 04:05.910
If we were back to the store and in the virtual machine Windows XP we found that Delta decie delete

04:05.910 --> 04:09.640
it and all the information was not deleted.

04:10.290 --> 04:15.330
And of course it's click on do this one we can get loaded.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.160
If we back to this one the file still available without any problem.

04:20.220 --> 04:27.320
The virtual machine is not disconnected because the change up on Abdula of the hard disk and other data

04:27.330 --> 04:34.670
that loaded into RAM didn't touch it with the snapshot.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.110
So the file still available.

04:37.320 --> 04:46.930
And no we can't box to any snapshot because we decided to delete all the fight off the snapshot.

04:47.150 --> 04:50.190
So how does it if we check any games available.

04:50.210 --> 04:57.320
We have the original VM the top pages of right and we do not have any information about another Dickey

04:57.500 --> 05:01.490
or about our Snapchat fight.

05:01.540 --> 05:04.030
So this is the idea of deleting the snapshot.

05:04.090 --> 05:12.850
This one still have the snapshot had has it is why it is part of and you are here in this one.

05:12.850 --> 05:19.420
You see the disk usage is about 1 megabytes because this one has zero megabytes Indurain it's only have

05:19.420 --> 05:25.620
the information about the new disk and the data or the snapshot it's it out.

05:25.660 --> 05:31.930
So that's we have only one gigabyte of the disk but this one is not of any snapshot yet.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.620
So this is the defendant's option or the snapshot.

05:35.620 --> 05:41.170
Please try to make some it's not what you seek or revert to latest snapshot is not readable.

05:41.190 --> 05:44.170
No because we have Xerox snapshots available.

05:44.580 --> 05:48.330
So I request you to make some snapshot.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.910
Some situations are just not true.

05:50.220 --> 05:56.970
You can create as much as you want others not try to revert back to one of them try to revert to up

05:56.970 --> 05:59.040
to do you want and so on and so on.

05:59.160 --> 06:06.960
And please share some screen capture of your practice with us so we can discover some striation so see

06:07.010 --> 06:12.470
in the next section that we'll going to discover a moderate future of the VM we see in the next review.
