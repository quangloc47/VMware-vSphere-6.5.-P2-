WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:01.310
Again.

00:01.410 --> 00:05.550
So let's try to see how the snapshot work.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.030
So for example we take a part on battery and machine that have the operating system to see the different

00:12.030 --> 00:14.590
that will happen when we take a snapshot.

00:14.610 --> 00:20.600
So no matter when you do a virtual machine in avi up or in our resource pool or in a house directly

00:20.610 --> 00:22.930
it's the same as always.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.970
So for example we take two windows xp 0 4 we parted on this virtual machine.

00:28.980 --> 00:37.110
It's in a power on process if we want to take a snapshot we click on it and we have the option called

00:37.230 --> 00:39.090
snap shot.

00:39.270 --> 00:43.970
Then you have take snapshots or Munnar snapshot or delete snapshot.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.430
By the way the snapshot can work in our life virtual machine.

00:48.430 --> 00:51.870
That's about it all or even in uploaded of virtual machine.

00:51.870 --> 00:57.670
This one that is part of we click on Sinatras we have not trawled my snapchat and it's not true.

00:57.870 --> 01:03.240
The other option is not available because the virtual machine have Xerox nuptials when we have on your

01:03.250 --> 01:08.870
snapshot we can revert to the latest one or do consolidate.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.100
So for example let's start with uploaded on one.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.250
How does this virtual machine that's still bolted on.

01:15.510 --> 01:20.450
And we try to take our Snapshot and covered different option we have.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.590
So it's very simple you will give it a name to that's not snapshot in.

01:25.590 --> 01:31.540
For example specific reason he chose automatically the date and time of this snapshot.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.510
Then you can add that description.

01:33.630 --> 01:53.870
One example before they do why it's like that or for example I want to in stall the anti virus like

01:53.900 --> 01:55.900
that's stupid put anything like that.

01:55.900 --> 02:02.090
We'll let you know that this not nuptials happened before making specific change or specific reason

02:02.270 --> 02:03.410
to do it.

02:03.470 --> 02:07.060
Then we have the auction snapshot of vitriol machine Memali.

02:07.070 --> 02:07.880
That's me.

02:08.120 --> 02:16.360
You are what is the snapshot to take us to do virtual machine memory during all the data that's logged

02:16.420 --> 02:17.300
in the rain.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.960
Also we'll take a snapshot of this one.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.230
So what's happened right here.

02:21.230 --> 02:24.970
It's like you make a standby to a virtual machine.

02:25.070 --> 02:31.690
If we back to this virtual machine like that power we chose this band that's me and we can't dispute

02:31.690 --> 02:32.450
your machine that's me.

02:32.480 --> 02:41.000
Aldo what available in memory in the room will be saved in the harddrive for keeping any in charge.

02:41.020 --> 02:47.520
So if it's any change that does not civets yet into how driver would not be open Microsoft Word.

02:47.540 --> 02:56.790
And you make some edits in then you still not save that editing when you click C-SPAN's it will save

02:56.790 --> 03:01.950
the file open it in the harddrive when your power on this virtual machine.

03:01.950 --> 03:09.120
It will load the file from the hard labor to the memory and you will find that on your file it still

03:09.240 --> 03:14.180
open with the chair that you make and still that not see it in the harddrive.

03:14.310 --> 03:16.050
So you need to chose

03:19.320 --> 03:22.330
snapshot and it's not just the virtual machine.

03:22.530 --> 03:30.940
If you check this one it's like you don't care about the data exists in memory and anything that's did

03:30.990 --> 03:36.610
not save it from the memory it will not take it from the snapshot it will last.

03:36.610 --> 03:42.780
All the data that loaded in the room it's like a power of the virtual machine and ticket was not shot

03:42.780 --> 03:50.700
then you live to a virtual machine originally powered on and you work with your snapshots that will

03:50.760 --> 03:54.480
only copy and pass do data of the hard drive.

03:54.540 --> 03:58.840
It will see only data of the harddrive not the data into memory.

03:59.130 --> 04:01.460
So for example we're back to this one.

04:01.620 --> 04:11.110
For example we have this document with up and this one like that's I remember this folder click right

04:11.130 --> 04:17.790
where we make our snap shot like that.

04:17.880 --> 04:22.120
So this fight is still save into memory.

04:22.260 --> 04:28.560
That's I mean we still not click on the save to save the chance of this one and we're going to make

04:28.590 --> 04:31.860
our nuptial So we have a virtual machine board on.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.180
We have some changes that still not save.

04:34.410 --> 04:42.360
And we click on them that your machine we chose snapshot take a snapshot we chose snapshot the virtual

04:42.360 --> 04:48.030
machine Memali And of course had to give us any information that you want.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.010
It is up.

04:49.390 --> 04:56.140
First off it's not shot like that and click OK.

04:56.510 --> 05:01.290
So we'll take snapshots creates virtual machines not SRODES.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.650
It is its task great virtual machine.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.700
It's not short.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.150
It will take a little time.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.110
It's information about the size of the memoir.

05:10.150 --> 05:13.850
So we have 200 megabytes of memory use it.

05:13.960 --> 05:22.300
So it will save two hundred megabytes of data into a hard driver of the snapshot.

05:22.300 --> 05:29.950
So when we chose not to do time take the latest knowledge is about the size consumer of the Memali.

05:30.010 --> 05:36.490
For example we have another virtual machine that's we have 16 of the RAM and consume about 10 gigabyte

05:36.490 --> 05:45.160
RAM so the snapshot will take the time to save the data of 10 gigabytes of room in a hard drive.

05:45.370 --> 05:48.640
So the speed is always in the region about the memory of course.

05:48.640 --> 05:55.900
If we don't chose to take a snapshot to uploaded on virtual machine it will be a little faster than

05:55.900 --> 05:59.560
this one will try to do it later.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.360
So for example in the process we can do it in our power grid on bitchen machine.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.350
So it's not just a snapshot in time.

06:07.350 --> 06:17.160
This option is not available because this machine is a part of this is a snap shot of our bow

06:20.010 --> 06:24.940
or head of virtual machine like that with click OK.

06:25.270 --> 06:32.710
And you see another task when it starts and which will happen faster because this machine is powered

06:32.740 --> 06:35.720
off that's mean we didn't copy anything current on one

06:40.050 --> 06:40.620
all.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.570
The first one still in its own time.

06:46.250 --> 07:05.180
So how does it degrades virtual machine make the migration because of the data as a rule.

07:05.350 --> 07:11.830
So you see the virtual machine is part of complex to do snapshot and the virtual machine that is bolted

07:11.830 --> 07:16.760
on still in the process of creating snapshots of the time.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.550
Take this one more then do what is right.

07:19.580 --> 07:21.090
So it's complete 100 percent.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.010
He just took a little time to finish the process.

07:24.010 --> 07:31.180
So here is it if you check the time for ISSUE 1 the virtual machine it on take more time than do one

07:31.510 --> 07:33.490
that is parted off.

07:33.550 --> 07:38.360
So if you book through the virtual machine that is bolted on when we take a snapshot and back retail

07:38.380 --> 07:41.070
you see the video machines do it work perfectly.

07:41.110 --> 07:48.190
And the challenge still available if we click like that and we ask you to save it to change.
