WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:05.670
So the question is why we need to use our Snapshot snapshots.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.240
We use it for a specific reason.

00:08.270 --> 00:11.780
For example we want to make an update to the operating system.

00:11.870 --> 00:19.460
We want to install our specific application or we want to do some important editing at the level of

00:19.460 --> 00:21.140
the system of this machine.

00:21.260 --> 00:27.220
But as we know for example when you make an update to the operation system then patients attempt to

00:27.230 --> 00:31.650
shut down and power on again or try to restart operations.

00:31.850 --> 00:39.210
You have a neural adalah of the file system and you've lost all the data available in this virtual machine.

00:39.260 --> 00:47.880
In this case to be in a safe mode that's mean you want to make an update but you try to avoid any problem

00:47.890 --> 00:50.630
happen to admit your machine and lost audio data.

00:50.630 --> 00:58.880
You take a snap shot to this virtual machine so you saved our original file that's worked perfectly

00:58.910 --> 01:08.390
in this game DFI and start working on a new VM liquified in case you are the update or do application

01:08.420 --> 01:14.220
or the software or for example the antivirus or any anything that you want to do is individual machine.

01:14.420 --> 01:20.990
But you are not sure that the process will go imperfectly without any problem or an individual machine

01:21.530 --> 01:28.860
you do it in the new VM decie file the Delta when the virtual machine completed the installation or

01:29.030 --> 01:35.870
updates or anything that you do in your machine then bolted on perfectly and work perfectly without

01:35.900 --> 01:39.010
any problem for example after two or three day or maybe five.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.370
It's an illusion about your situation.

01:41.590 --> 01:44.800
Then you see that all of that work perfectly.

01:44.900 --> 01:54.810
And Divisoria machine work perfectly then complete using new updates by using our delayed option.

01:54.840 --> 02:01.550
We're going to see it's when you chose to delete the snapshot all the change happen in just one copy

02:01.640 --> 02:08.670
and save it in do our original VM Dicky and David become read and write.

02:08.750 --> 02:15.200
And this one deleted and any changes happen right here Kopete and civies in the original VM decie.

02:15.230 --> 02:20.840
So in this situation everything is perfect but in a model CNR you something happened to the virtual

02:20.840 --> 02:26.850
machine and the virtual machine crashes and won't boot anymore again.

02:27.170 --> 02:32.230
And you find some that are lost and a lot of problem happened to this virtual machine.

02:32.510 --> 02:37.560
If you want to reinstall this virtual machine it will take you a lot of time.

02:37.730 --> 02:41.070
Also all the data available will be lost etc..

02:41.130 --> 02:44.910
Also we have our bad situation in this scenario.

02:45.200 --> 02:52.640
But in the situation that is a snapshot you simply got to this virtual machine and chose to revert back

02:52.640 --> 02:55.770
to our original version.

02:55.780 --> 03:03.740
That's mean this video machine will disconnect to this new VM details but all the changes that will

03:03.740 --> 03:10.420
happen here will be related and we'll start using the OTS you know VM decie without any change up into

03:10.430 --> 03:11.240
this one.

03:11.240 --> 03:16.090
So this virtual machine it's like back to the original time before doing snapshots.

03:16.220 --> 03:22.460
It's like when you restore your machine you back to the original time or original date of the virtual

03:22.460 --> 03:23.030
machine.

03:23.030 --> 03:29.420
So it does connect to this VM Dickie Delta at the top of the problem and reconnect to this one and work

03:29.450 --> 03:32.510
perfectly with the original VM Dicky.

03:32.810 --> 03:39.800
And in this situation we have a save that are available for this mature machine but also you should

03:39.800 --> 03:45.680
know that any updates happen from the user that connect with this vision machine as you are an administrator

03:45.980 --> 03:46.960
of this virtual machine.

03:46.970 --> 03:52.820
You want to update something to your machine but there are some user who connect to this one and do

03:53.120 --> 03:55.500
his own job for example.

03:55.530 --> 04:04.140
Are they in the eye of the client or is it at all when you chose Joe Reebok to do all regional V.M..

04:04.140 --> 04:10.580
Dickie let's me and you found a problem in this update and you aren't back to the original one.

04:10.580 --> 04:15.640
Aldo civets fondu use that in that time will be deleted.

04:15.650 --> 04:22.460
So in this case we always recommended to boot this machine out of service in the time that you want

04:22.460 --> 04:26.390
to make an update and you want to take a snapshot.

04:26.570 --> 04:33.740
So the idea you put this virgin machine out of service lets me any sort of connect to this machine will

04:33.740 --> 04:36.500
front this machine in available for a moment.

04:36.500 --> 04:45.890
You make a snapshot you create the data and automatically then updated the software or do anything that

04:45.890 --> 04:49.730
you want to do to dispute your machine when everything is OK.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.200
Then you get to this machine available for the user.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.780
And in this situation you don't last any that often do use.

04:58.250 --> 05:05.220
And of course after that you it the snapshot you integrate and updates of this delta-V indicate to the

05:05.300 --> 05:07.510
original wall and so on and so on.

05:07.520 --> 05:16.370
Also we have another rule that we can't create more than 30 to snapshot to a virtual machine when we

05:16.370 --> 05:18.770
create a snapshot number one.

05:18.770 --> 05:25.040
For example you want to On-Star tree software to the important software in your virtual machine but

05:25.550 --> 05:33.230
you need to do it with a stick once you start to remember what the software number to then do software

05:33.320 --> 05:39.200
number three in that situation you take a snapshot to the original virtual machine.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.920
Then you installed a application that you want the application number one.

05:43.970 --> 05:47.420
So all those channels will be saved in a snapshot.

05:47.510 --> 05:50.980
VM decie that Delta number one.

05:51.170 --> 05:54.430
Then you take another snapshot to this machine.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.130
That's me.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.830
This churn is work perfectly.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.260
You weren't last does change.

05:59.270 --> 06:01.510
You need to create another snapshot.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.680
It's great the word VM dignified.

06:03.710 --> 06:09.650
That's galley's sig and they'll Talvi indicate then you upload the second application.

06:09.650 --> 06:12.320
If an application were perfectly That's great.

06:12.350 --> 06:16.240
If not you want simply book to do snapshot number one.

06:16.250 --> 06:20.930
And in this situation you already have the application want as salad without any problem.

06:20.990 --> 06:23.270
You don't need to back to the original VM.

06:23.330 --> 06:29.780
And then you try to start the application and br1 and the application number two again and three down.

06:30.200 --> 06:35.430
So when you create the stick at the one if it's work perfectly then you create a modern snapshot.

06:35.720 --> 06:40.920
The third one then you install due to the application and so on and so on.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.530
So in this situation you have midships snapshot all the VM.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.150
Dicky delta-V and ticket connect to the original one.

06:49.220 --> 06:51.470
The second one connects to the first one.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.850
The third one connects to the second one and the second one wanted to do the first one and so on and

06:55.850 --> 06:56.840
so on.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.220
Then when everything is perfect you delete the snapshots.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.880
So all the channels happen into the delta.

07:04.060 --> 07:11.950
The key will be saved in the original VM decie and the machines are worked again and not the information

07:11.960 --> 07:19.380
that you can't leave the snapshot file for a long time for about one month.

07:19.410 --> 07:20.630
Come on that is true.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.710
Delete any snapshot older than one month.

07:24.730 --> 07:30.740
But if you create the snapshot and you start working on it this neighborhood you can use it up to one

07:31.130 --> 07:32.690
month at about 13.

07:32.700 --> 07:40.430
They more than 20 in this snapshot will start giving you a problem because this file will be bigger

07:40.430 --> 07:46.040
and bigger and bigger every time you make a change in this video machine or you use that to save a file

07:46.070 --> 07:48.190
or create or find this.

07:48.350 --> 07:54.500
Delta-V immediately have a big size and so on and so on then you will have overloading on the space

07:54.800 --> 07:59.780
overloading on the input output of the harddrive and so on and so on.

07:59.930 --> 08:08.000
So it is always recommended to delete any snapshot older than 13 died and keep using the original VM

08:08.000 --> 08:11.520
decie to work in a safe place.

08:11.540 --> 08:15.300
This is not about how the snapshot work.

08:15.350 --> 08:21.530
It's a simple tool you can use it in specific time when you want to make an update to the between machine

08:21.890 --> 08:26.240
or you want to use for example as our temporary backup.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.210
It's not our backup to the virtual machine.

08:29.210 --> 08:33.650
This is our Bompard backup for example every week or every two week.

08:33.680 --> 08:40.010
You create a snapshot of the machine and leave the user do his job without any problem.

08:40.070 --> 08:46.250
If something wrong happen from the user to this virtual machine you're simply back to the preview snapshot

08:46.580 --> 08:48.230
or to the original one.

08:48.350 --> 08:52.810
It's not about the level of the snapshot you have for example if you create five snapshots.

08:52.940 --> 08:55.340
Then you come back to the natural number four.

08:55.490 --> 08:58.170
Then you come back to the snapshot number.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.630
And so on and so on.

08:59.870 --> 09:05.610
But this is our top story backup because any is not older than 13.

09:05.750 --> 09:11.630
It start getting new problem or the machine will start freezing the machine that's connected to the

09:11.720 --> 09:17.890
4 or 5 snapshot and do snapshot start consuming more size of the driver.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.840
This virtual machine will start freezing.

09:20.900 --> 09:25.620
So this is the idea of the snapshot see the next video in the real exam.
