WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:07.770
So when we chose do reverts back we have put on writing articles relevant to the VM to the state it

00:07.770 --> 00:08.620
was in.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.340
We do not know what was taking.

00:11.340 --> 00:16.370
So remember we have to file this this is for the snapshot.

00:16.370 --> 00:17.670
Number one this is for the.

00:17.690 --> 00:22.550
Number two if we try to add any editing right there it will be deleted.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.980
Without saving this data writer.

00:28.310 --> 00:36.890
So another rule that you should know if you try to revert back to the snapshot number three in any situation

00:36.980 --> 00:45.260
you can revert back to the snapshot number to and from that natural number you can revert back to those

00:45.320 --> 00:47.200
not short number one.

00:47.210 --> 00:52.170
So if we try to back to the Snark number like that we just click on this one.

00:52.290 --> 00:57.860
Just want to your machine when reverting to the neighborhood I tell you that this option if you have

00:57.860 --> 01:01.620
some use it or it just makes your machine click yes.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.070
Rivette snapshot to this one.

01:04.070 --> 01:08.330
If we click on it you will find that this wall will be disconnected.

01:08.810 --> 01:09.930
Give me some little time.

01:11.190 --> 01:14.280
The task take its own time to spark

01:22.950 --> 01:23.850
that is it.

01:23.900 --> 01:28.810
You see that you are hurt in the snapshot number two.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.900
So if you box to a virtual machine and refresh you will find that do find them is deleted because the

01:35.900 --> 01:39.670
file created after making this natural number talk.

01:39.950 --> 01:46.040
Then if you back right here and click on the snapshot and battery let's try to see what would happen

01:46.040 --> 01:47.190
right there.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.150
OK.

01:48.350 --> 01:54.850
That's me and we want to go to the snapshot number three this mean back to the previous states before

01:55.880 --> 02:08.810
buckling to this natural number to that is it's.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.210
So you are here it's worked perfectly.

02:11.210 --> 02:14.030
If we check this one.

02:14.440 --> 02:23.830
Refresh the file number two buck so we can move between this one to this one and this one to this one.

02:23.830 --> 02:30.300
But of course if you go back to this snapshot number two and make it when you're back to the snapshot

02:30.310 --> 02:33.000
number three alde editing will be lost.

02:33.010 --> 02:35.800
So let's try it for example bucketed the snapshot.

02:35.800 --> 02:44.430
Number two does it not back in the file it will be deleted.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.420
So I headed back to that snapshot.

02:55.420 --> 03:00.510
Number two if you back to the virtual machine you have the file number one.

03:00.530 --> 03:11.000
Only if we try to create for example a mother file like that for example number for me we have a folder

03:11.500 --> 03:16.200
called number for let's try to make some other situation.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.700
For example we create a snapshot from this one like that.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.610
Take a snapshot.

03:22.630 --> 03:30.430
One example this one will be Snape George number two.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.640
Mean inside is natural number two and we create a second one.

03:34.700 --> 03:35.270
So.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.040
Let's see what would happen right here.

03:48.930 --> 03:53.130
So you see snapshot number two is Abdul-Malik of the snapshot.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.980
Number three.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.440
So we have two snapshots formed original snapshot as natural numbers to give us snapshot man memory

04:01.510 --> 04:04.290
and natural number 2 0 2.

04:04.510 --> 04:11.390
So if we back right here and for example creates an updates for those natural numbers to but this will

04:11.390 --> 04:12.190
be two

04:15.100 --> 04:19.310
like that's my nurse and talk like that.

04:19.750 --> 04:24.880
I mean this is the file does not show them but talk 0 2.

04:24.990 --> 04:31.800
So if we try to back to the snapshot number three of course if remembered the file number two will back

04:31.950 --> 04:39.120
this to a file will be deleted because we create some in Abdula bit of the SNOPT should number two but

04:39.420 --> 04:47.160
that it does not exist in the snapshot number 3 because of a snapshot before reverts back to the snapshot

04:47.280 --> 04:48.420
number two.

04:48.420 --> 04:52.560
So let's try to go back to the Sinatra and Buttrick.

04:52.690 --> 05:00.710
It's something very funny you move between a different snapshot but of course when you decide to finish

05:00.770 --> 05:07.440
the editing of the snapshot you will take the latest one that you have editing.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.220
So of course the machine will be disconnected again.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.120
This disconnect only happened in the browser.

05:15.130 --> 05:22.010
If you use them workstation division machine will be available and maybe it will disconnect and connect

05:22.070 --> 05:25.670
automatically without needing to refresh the browser.

05:26.210 --> 05:31.850
So what is it you are here in snapshot number three if you are back to just want to discover what's

05:31.850 --> 05:33.640
happened right here.

05:33.650 --> 05:37.590
We see that defined number two back but define number three.

05:37.700 --> 05:46.730
And two point two is deleted so we can move between the different snapshot for example this one we installed

05:46.730 --> 05:52.060
application and br1 this wonderful application of Berto and the other one for the application industry.

05:52.070 --> 05:56.070
When you're finished the difference not short then you just Jew.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.490
Delays are natural.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.840
So the next you would see how to delete those snapshot.
