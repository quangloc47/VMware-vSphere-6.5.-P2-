WEBVTT

00:01.880 --> 00:09.510
Blogging so after scanning the line of the different host we can check Do available updates that we

00:09.510 --> 00:11.310
need to use it in our homes.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.050
So we click on that number.

00:13.050 --> 00:14.200
How do you see that.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.770
We have updated al-Hadi as tallied those option right here.

00:18.870 --> 00:24.720
She did try to get information about it and you can go to the link is already as tallied in a different

00:24.780 --> 00:25.800
E6 I host.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.660
How do you see that we have some missing updates.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.340
For example this one is critical if we click on the design right here.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.650
You see this is about to do.

00:35.710 --> 00:39.640
Indeed it is 6.5 to no more etc..

00:39.660 --> 00:40.550
For more information.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.430
Is this like.

00:41.610 --> 00:48.540
Did it show your disability is critical then the impact that you will need to reboot and maintenance

00:48.540 --> 00:48.950
more.

00:48.990 --> 00:54.690
In the host to complete this installation What is up with this update is important but does not need

00:54.690 --> 00:58.110
to reboot or to put the horse into maintenance mode.

00:58.230 --> 01:02.050
This one about do the IB.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.050
Then we have some other one.

01:04.240 --> 01:11.200
And if you remember where we have to excite Explorer 5 but if we checked Isak's I 5.5 we don't have

01:11.260 --> 01:20.380
any updates for that because Ald. I hope that we have does not have to 5.5 to make to upgrade or to

01:20.500 --> 01:21.940
update it.

01:22.090 --> 01:27.800
So all the other vision is not show up always show not applicable.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.250
So its only show due 6.5 if you remember that we can talk about it.

01:33.250 --> 01:37.550
That's all the show available is a host in your environments.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.160
So this is the difference.

01:39.250 --> 01:42.740
Update our environment need to upgrade.

01:42.760 --> 01:49.270
The difference is XCI host so the same for the second one to do it right its the same because we use

01:49.270 --> 01:52.130
the same version of the house in the tree E6.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.470
I sort of.

01:54.600 --> 02:01.170
So then if we got to do cluster live it and in the same we checked the update manager we have only do

02:01.270 --> 02:03.580
hosts but we don't see do.

02:03.580 --> 02:09.240
VM were two parts because the VM where its not integration about the cluster or do is excite is integration

02:09.300 --> 02:11.490
about the virtual machine.

02:11.490 --> 02:15.600
So the same right here you can click on it to check the non-compliant.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.580
Then a delivery of it is x.

02:17.580 --> 02:25.760
I host also we can do busline or the halls base where you see the different desires about the update

02:25.790 --> 02:28.240
necessity in this is because I host.

02:28.380 --> 02:35.040
Of course if there are another Isak's I host with a moderate version of our model updates you will see

02:35.100 --> 02:39.630
a different return for this one need 15 missing updates.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.840
The other one we have only about 3 updates.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.790
The other one that I have is I 5.5.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.620
We have about 13 updates etc..

02:48.780 --> 02:56.110
So you see the demise of all the different updates for the difference is excite I host did Abdula of

02:56.110 --> 03:03.520
the virtual machine if we got the update manager you will find that we have only the VM where two updates

03:03.850 --> 03:04.990
of course.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.670
Horst Berge is an illusion about course.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.990
It is illogical you found the host's page.

03:11.080 --> 03:17.530
I believe in individual machine because its is not of any relation about the virtual machine.

03:17.530 --> 03:23.470
So if you back to the Adamy if you like that then we go to the Hospers line.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.360
The Virtual Machine busline

03:28.560 --> 03:38.080
or just back to the house and cluster if we back to the start and we got to do them well to upgrade.

03:38.220 --> 03:46.410
We scan for it and of course it will not detect any updates because it necessary to upgrade the hosts

03:46.410 --> 03:54.280
before we will Abitur check do upgrades of the VM which are our delivery of the virtual machine you

03:54.290 --> 04:01.720
see right here compliant is already compliant does incompatible the swamp that there's no talk on operating

04:01.750 --> 04:10.430
systems so it is incomplete even then Inconel this one for the full two reasons this one can't be upgraded

04:10.430 --> 04:11.840
because it does not exist.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.380
It's just our middle of the virtual machine.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.320
Number four.

04:17.430 --> 04:25.380
So you see VM x 0 4 and Inconel 0 for the same mystery machine exists in in Cuno in compliant.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.920
So it should destry virtual machine.

04:27.970 --> 04:34.140
That's half the VM we're it is compliant that's mean there's not need any updates.

04:34.150 --> 04:34.510
Why.

04:34.510 --> 04:43.600
Because we didn't upgrade it because I host so the check or the scan is between the virtual machine

04:43.720 --> 04:52.430
and the VM were available in E6 I host because they were to exist at the level of the eye holes exist

04:52.480 --> 04:54.540
with high ISO.

04:54.720 --> 05:01.420
So it took a compliance between the virtual machine VM which were studied individually and do what we

05:01.470 --> 05:04.110
were taught exist in do I host.

05:04.120 --> 05:10.710
So it's compliance that actually does one does not have the VM so that's why it's incompatible.

05:10.720 --> 05:18.190
I mean do not have the VM were true and one cannot one because this is just the middle of a virtual

05:18.190 --> 05:19.300
machine.

05:19.360 --> 05:27.640
When we upgrade the different tool off of the years I host the hypervisor automatically Dovi we're told

05:27.640 --> 05:30.270
will be updated in E6 I host.

05:30.370 --> 05:36.340
So when we check any updates for the VM we're taught at the level of the virtual machine it will detect

05:36.370 --> 05:44.070
the difference between New York version available and the existing vision started in a different machine.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.430
So here in the next video.
