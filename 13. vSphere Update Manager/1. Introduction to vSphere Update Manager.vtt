Hello and welcome again in this new section.

00:05.670 --> 00:14.670
So if you follow do fall training course the first part and the second part you'll see that we cover

00:15.090 --> 00:22.590
all those available tape right there the monitor de-conflict permission Holst's at our store network

00:22.980 --> 00:26.680
but we never talk about to update.

00:27.030 --> 00:31.160
No distinction will want to cover the update manager.

00:31.650 --> 00:40.410
So what is the update manager to prove your vision of the VM where this fit 6 1 or 5 1 5 do updates

00:40.440 --> 00:42.440
manager was not available.

00:42.450 --> 00:50.990
They actually talk to the central server or from the different I host it was necessary to entendu Update

00:51.000 --> 01:00.260
Manager integrated with different holes and the center server to be able to make updates no from 6.5

01:00.540 --> 01:03.080
the update manager is utter shit.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.660
They actually do this on our server.

01:05.710 --> 01:12.140
Two different E6 I was so in discussion were going to talk about do updates Manado.

01:12.250 --> 01:20.980
So we go to home and we have a tape Khaled's update manager to get information about the updates manager

01:21.070 --> 01:23.580
into the center server.

01:23.650 --> 01:24.700
So the next three.
