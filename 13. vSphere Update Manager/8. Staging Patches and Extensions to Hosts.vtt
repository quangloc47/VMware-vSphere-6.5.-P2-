00:02.100 --> 00:02.810
Blogging.

00:03.030 --> 00:07.740
So let's try to make Ah an update to the different tasks.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.440
So we got to do a new bass line.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.770
We have three it I host but need to get an update.

00:13.770 --> 00:19.770
So if you remember we can go with dramady directly or we need to choose stage based.

00:19.890 --> 00:22.180
So I chose stage based.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.880
So you see the bass line profile.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.350
We check this one then next then it true the difference is I how's that need you to download.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.510
You can download them all for you if I want.

00:34.710 --> 00:35.960
Or two or three.

00:35.970 --> 00:41.090
So to save time of course they have the same file so it will download the same file.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.870
It's will not be the difference when you chose 3 or 1.

00:45.060 --> 00:52.400
But in my situation I will apply example into it because I want because I can't apply this update to

00:52.410 --> 00:58.760
it because I treat when it will reboot I will lost the sense of server that exist in Isak's I number

00:58.760 --> 00:59.200
three.

00:59.370 --> 01:02.160
So for that we'll concentrate on the Isak's I want.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.330
Maybe we can do Isak's I talk together.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.380
So we click next.

01:07.460 --> 01:12.850
It should decide about a different one that can be upgraded.

01:13.960 --> 01:20.190
Number of the holes to mean this Feistel not exist yet.

01:20.280 --> 01:28.290
It should be downloaded next then how much costs how much each line how much birched necessary.

01:28.290 --> 01:31.420
It's about 15 pages that need to be downloaded.

01:31.710 --> 01:38.980
So we collect next and do state Bache will start it will start downloading the defendant Bache of it

01:38.990 --> 01:46.560
even scanning object Isak's I want it's kind of an object E-6 Aitu And let's give it a little time to

01:46.980 --> 01:48.480
complete to download policies

01:52.640 --> 02:02.860
so it start downloading some fine that is about it different and find thought Gagin of Bartsch Isak's

02:02.940 --> 02:07.230
I do different name of the page that need to be done the

02:10.710 --> 02:14.920
saw you see it start making some stage for different musics.

02:14.930 --> 02:28.290
I host so the thought process in not changed shape and dienen how Stage 4 is X I want task's stage then

02:28.310 --> 02:29.090
for the ESX.

02:29.100 --> 02:33.210
I too thought we sin except if we select is x.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.490
I host it with stage.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.380
All of them

02:39.590 --> 02:43.150
so it's look like a two stage process will take more time.

02:43.370 --> 02:53.270
So I will cancel this process to not losing more time because I found that the file downloaded are big

02:53.330 --> 02:57.930
fine so it will take a lot of time and will slow your environment.

02:57.950 --> 03:04.010
Of course the stage process integration about the speed connection you have if you have a slow connection

03:04.150 --> 03:05.380
due process will be too.

03:05.430 --> 03:09.550
Longer if you have a fast connection to process it will be a little faster.

03:09.770 --> 03:18.230
So they just ignore staged process and just give you a quick overview about how to apply do updates.

03:18.320 --> 03:26.210
Of course in our example will not going to update because the stage process didn't complete So the next

03:26.410 --> 03:28.840
will see how to apply do update.
