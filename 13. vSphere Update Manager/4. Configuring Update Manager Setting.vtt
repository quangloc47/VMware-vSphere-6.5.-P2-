00:01.520 --> 00:02.270
Hello again.

00:02.330 --> 00:11.650
So no we have some Haast busy line and we can connect to E6 I host one of those baseliner and then check

00:11.650 --> 00:16.640
the compatibility or compliance with those hostages life.

00:16.670 --> 00:22.130
It's like what we did with the host profiled we connect to host provider and check if they are compliant

00:22.220 --> 00:23.230
or not.

00:23.450 --> 00:24.860
So the same we can't do it.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.960
We do have a baseline of updates.

00:28.070 --> 00:34.130
Then we have some baseline group if we want to create some specification group etc. to do same as the

00:34.250 --> 00:43.260
host line just use it by them troll a group then we have V.M. baseline that is information about virtual

00:43.260 --> 00:51.700
machine you see virtual machine updates to latticed then VM Where had the war upgrade the end of VM

00:51.700 --> 00:58.740
were to upgrade too much to host this one about the vitriol appliance upgrade it's about individual

00:58.790 --> 01:01.510
planes the individual machine hardware upgrade.

01:01.610 --> 01:05.310
That's mean you upgrade the driver of the hardware.

01:05.430 --> 01:10.040
There were two holes to upgrade to much of the house.

01:10.090 --> 01:15.890
This is information about the VM were true that's unstarted into different virtual machine you can upgrade

01:15.890 --> 01:22.310
to them where to do this information of course you can get details about them.

01:22.480 --> 01:31.720
Then the same we have busline group then have a do E6 I would imagine this is a very useful tool that's

01:31.760 --> 01:40.480
mean if you want to upgrade from five point five to six or to 6.5 you don't need to do it manually you

01:40.570 --> 01:45.150
simply import the ISO image of Isak's light you see right there.

01:45.160 --> 01:52.760
You can upgrade multiple hosts of different pension simultaneously by using an image upload only.

01:52.820 --> 01:57.330
I image that you will use is the browser button below to select.

01:57.370 --> 02:04.100
I imagine which you want is not some important are large and might take several months.

02:04.330 --> 02:08.100
Then of course your browser to upload is a moderator.

02:08.320 --> 02:15.900
Then he would automatically evacuates the vitriol machine from that host and update the effects I host.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.580
They actually from the master of the house.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.060
Then we'll reboot it is x I host we do new version.

02:23.110 --> 02:28.330
So this is on this tool you can use it to upgrade your dependence is it create a host.

02:28.420 --> 02:36.010
But of course you should be careful when you will migrate your virtual machine etc. then we box it sitting

02:36.010 --> 02:42.370
right where we have network connectivity that's mean the connectivity between this fear updates manager

02:42.460 --> 02:44.320
and the center server.

02:44.440 --> 02:52.000
It is already configured because from the vision 5:06 it's configured to connect between the center

02:52.000 --> 02:53.880
server and the update manager.

02:54.010 --> 02:58.140
So we don't need to change any time right here because it is allowed to exist.

02:58.140 --> 03:04.780
How does it that is all the hostname for the parts store and store the update into recentre server then

03:04.870 --> 03:10.220
the server port and port for client communication with updates manager server.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.870
Then we have done a lot sitting down long sitting.

03:13.990 --> 03:18.670
Hey check it connectivity to get information from this link.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.030
Here we have a difference.

03:20.050 --> 03:28.390
You're about to do updates available that download the page of the updates you see download so download

03:28.390 --> 03:35.350
new page and visit appliance upgrade either at intervals PCF it in download skiddoo or immediate by

03:35.390 --> 03:37.520
clicking download now button.

03:37.660 --> 03:44.690
That's when you click download button now and you will download different and I'll be able to get do

03:44.780 --> 03:52.010
a different bait update how do you check the difference you are l the Haast updates from the VM where

03:52.020 --> 03:54.980
the dot.com software et cetera.

03:55.050 --> 03:57.460
We have the app update et cetera.

03:57.660 --> 04:04.710
And then of course you can it it does you harm by clicking it there then you can for example challenge

04:04.710 --> 04:06.800
any of them by default.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.510
You can't delete them.

04:08.580 --> 04:15.570
You can't just disable it then you can add for example if you have the HP Service you can get our updated

04:15.570 --> 04:24.120
driver from the HP by searching in Google about your end the update manager of HP on them or you can

04:24.140 --> 04:25.620
establish contacts.

04:25.750 --> 04:29.540
Wonder service to give you the different you had for.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.610
Do hardware updates and the software update.

04:32.620 --> 04:40.680
If for example the plugging for hardware monitor etc. you can get to them right here and attempt to

04:40.680 --> 04:41.400
do list.

04:41.410 --> 04:50.470
For example if you have a core hardware you can get updates from Cisco Dell of course a shared repository

04:50.710 --> 04:54.160
of our shared repository for a of the central server.

04:54.160 --> 05:00.060
You can write right then then we have the proxy.

05:00.070 --> 05:05.320
If you use a proxy in your environment you need to add the proxy writer used a proxy.

05:05.320 --> 05:10.800
For example a proxy for the update for connection to the network etc..

05:11.170 --> 05:18.950
But of course when you are the deuce your end of the search space you need to enable those in your firewall.

05:18.970 --> 05:26.010
If you have firewall security that disable any connection and only allow some specific it yourself you

05:26.090 --> 05:34.420
need to up to list in firewall to allow the center server the upgrade manager to be able to connect

05:34.420 --> 05:37.660
to the network and specifically traduce you are l.

05:37.930 --> 05:44.800
Then we have to download schedule to get specification time to download enables you to download Yes

05:45.280 --> 05:52.450
task named VM where respire update manager update download task description frequently daily blast around

05:52.450 --> 05:53.120
Inconel.

05:53.140 --> 05:58.510
Next around will be the next day in the morning so we can see this option.

05:58.540 --> 06:05.290
We can disable reschedule download and we back to the download setting and do it manually or we enable

06:05.290 --> 06:11.540
it to use it like that next day and give it our task name.

06:11.560 --> 06:16.980
So when you all check your log file you'll find that you have VM were updates manager.

06:17.170 --> 06:24.460
Then you can chance the specification time by doing daily or weekly or monthly or how specific each

06:24.700 --> 06:29.350
time or in this specific time or around no.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.450
So you can't it's Aldo's information.

06:32.530 --> 06:41.290
Next day when you're finished editing didn't have that notification check skittle to get an education.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.530
So next we'll completes the other posting we have soon the next.
