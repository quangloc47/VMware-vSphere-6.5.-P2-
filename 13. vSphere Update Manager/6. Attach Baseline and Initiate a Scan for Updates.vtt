00:01.410 --> 00:02.080
Blogging.

00:02.250 --> 00:11.110
So let's try to attach our busline to the data center to check compliance and what will happen.

00:11.250 --> 00:15.080
So we are back to the home horse and cluster.

00:15.350 --> 00:23.130
And we can attach it to the bus line for the different location for example in the Santer we have data

00:23.200 --> 00:30.200
manager at delivery of the class that are so we can attach it to the hosts baseline and a delivery of

00:30.220 --> 00:32.880
do is X Y is the same.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.460
So let's DeWitt's from delivery of do data center.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.130
So we get updates from delivery of the data center.

00:40.310 --> 00:47.510
So we certainly in the data center Morakot we got to update it and we click Attash busline.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.000
So here we see the difference because line available in our environment we check the ones that we want.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.900
For example no baseline that we created order noncritical Hall's order category.

00:58.100 --> 01:03.970
Then we have a delivery of the virtual machine the hardware and Devane which are for example is being

01:04.010 --> 01:05.640
worked well for your information.

01:05.670 --> 01:12.910
VM where to upgrade is only available and can be a delivery of or something you can't attach should

01:13.160 --> 01:15.440
the bus line all the way through.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.340
A delivery of it is if I host or adalah of it of the cluster.

01:19.340 --> 01:23.110
You could do it only for all do that doesn't.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.850
So we click OK betrothals do what we want.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.500
That is it.

01:27.680 --> 01:35.290
So then we have the upgrade and Horst busline your attache to do that Astar.

01:35.340 --> 01:42.210
So if we click on any of them like that you see that we have an empty list of complaint that's me.

01:42.270 --> 01:48.750
It does not know if there's a difference between a machine and the host is compliant or not compliant

01:48.810 --> 01:50.210
or incompatible.

01:50.270 --> 01:53.520
It didn't or like what we did with the hosts profile.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.870
We have three Isak's.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.260
I have a state.

01:56.300 --> 02:04.410
And you know you don't know if the updates in this one have compliance with the I host it in Inconnu

02:04.660 --> 02:11.800
Also in with us we have the difference between a machine and we have the state Inconnu.

02:11.850 --> 02:16.760
So let's start we do know busline Abdula of the hosts.

02:16.830 --> 02:24.630
So you see we have three yes I host interested in Keino didn't have new button available skein the selected

02:24.630 --> 02:27.910
inventory object for pait and or upgrade.

02:28.080 --> 02:28.700
That's me.

02:28.710 --> 02:34.450
It will check those I host and do updates available on the view.

02:34.450 --> 02:37.090
What are they are compliant or no.

02:37.290 --> 02:45.930
Do you have state page and remediate go to admin it's real let us back to the updates manager then remediate.

02:45.930 --> 02:53.370
It's like in starlet's mean start the remediate resort to refine patch or upgrade to apply to do it

02:53.430 --> 02:54.770
involuntarily object.

02:54.810 --> 03:01.470
That's really what will check the different updates available for those E-6 I host it will download

03:01.590 --> 03:07.870
the updates and start installation of the updates for the difference is a host if necessary some hosts

03:07.890 --> 03:10.680
will put in montanum smart and reboot.

03:10.680 --> 03:19.740
If not it will only add updates of it even then we have stage beat State beat is to download the specific

03:19.850 --> 03:23.520
page to host you selected which are.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.400
Remediate is faster.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.300
You see remediate is faster.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.100
Why when did you use state page in case that remedied.

03:33.180 --> 03:37.140
Also download the update then unstored update.

03:37.620 --> 03:46.550
If we chose to remediate directly it will put the horse into maintenance mode then it start downloading

03:46.560 --> 03:51.360
do updates and installed updates the one by one.

03:51.390 --> 03:58.700
In this case your host will be in dimension for a long time and of course in the raid environment it's

03:58.710 --> 04:04.800
not necessary to have an X in meant and a smart or out of service for a long time.

04:04.980 --> 04:08.200
You should make two updates as quick as possible.

04:08.220 --> 04:11.140
So for that you need to use stage paid.

04:11.220 --> 04:20.850
It will download all the available update for your E6 I host and put them inside a store out of the

04:20.860 --> 04:26.950
resentence server and when you chose remediate it will automatically start the installation from the

04:27.030 --> 04:31.290
available updates available in your central server.

04:31.290 --> 04:36.090
Of course we need to start with discomfort update to see any updates available.

04:36.140 --> 04:37.660
The difference is it's a host.

04:37.860 --> 04:44.780
So we click scan and it will ask you to scan the page and extension or upgrade.

04:44.850 --> 04:48.590
Of course where it will check to upgrade fine.

04:48.600 --> 04:56.370
Of course in our situation we don't need to wait for one or two how to check any upgrade available so

04:56.370 --> 04:57.860
we can check this one.

04:57.930 --> 05:02.460
Then I would check the virtual appliance because we don't need the virtual applies right.

05:02.560 --> 05:09.360
No we all keep doing what you or the VM where hardware and the page and the extension.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.110
Of course in the right environment you need to check this one.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.140
This one if you need to get updates about the vitriol appliance you do it.

05:16.140 --> 05:22.160
If not you don't care about it but upgrade is necessary to make the upgrade.

05:22.190 --> 05:25.910
For the difference E-6 I host.

05:25.950 --> 05:33.300
So we click OK and upgrade we'll start and discarnate will start a bit of the data center.

05:33.480 --> 05:46.060
So odd I host and cluster but in this one will scan it by the updates Monell so you can do diffidence

05:46.100 --> 05:54.350
Isak's I host Isak's I want to three.

05:54.360 --> 06:02.540
The difference between a machine.

06:02.860 --> 06:12.210
So how does it know it shows you that we have internal state we need to refresh to get your updates

06:12.220 --> 06:17.830
so you see no increase or become zero and noncompliance become free.

06:17.860 --> 06:22.270
That's mean we have three host not complied with the latest update.
