00:00.810 --> 00:01.570
Blogging.

00:01.810 --> 00:09.000
So when we get inside update manager of the sphere we have some even try help you can't check it to

00:09.000 --> 00:16.920
different events happen for the update manager like information about the update.

00:17.350 --> 00:24.380
That can happen etc. but it's not to be envious of this mother chicken communication cannot be complex

00:24.400 --> 00:27.220
because Chick much or vocation didn't complete.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.190
That's why we have a neuro chickenshit equation that we're not.

00:30.340 --> 00:36.670
But divination had successfully download Haast definition of Partch etc..

00:37.030 --> 00:38.620
So this is the difference.

00:39.130 --> 00:43.050
Even right here we have some notification about the update.

00:43.060 --> 00:50.230
If you have an investigation then we have to manage the target setting of the Update Manager.

00:50.470 --> 00:57.430
So we have a sitting host busline the host is like a the host profile that we see in the preview.

00:57.430 --> 00:59.330
This is for the updates.

00:59.440 --> 01:07.180
Then we have the M the butterfly patch opposites really excite image and the spare appliance upgrade

01:07.480 --> 01:09.290
this for the VCR upgrade.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.330
We don't use it frequently.

01:11.410 --> 01:16.160
It's only about the sphere appliance to get the updates for the appliance.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.750
Then we have some other tape right hand.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.580
So let's go check them one by one let's start.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.500
We do patch replicate.

01:23.530 --> 01:28.860
So do we find the different page of the update.

01:28.900 --> 01:34.720
So we heard the name of the fate update is X based update.

01:35.230 --> 01:38.910
Driver is exposed to light is X5.

01:39.010 --> 01:40.180
And so on and so on.

01:40.190 --> 01:51.350
Ald. updates available about do environments then you see the product is embedded is x 6 and 5 et cetera

01:52.260 --> 01:53.170
of course.

01:53.240 --> 02:00.230
Pait updated automatically from the VM Where do release date.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.530
So this is a very old version this is 4 x 5.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.590
That's mean if you use it 6 i 5 want 5 in your environment.

02:09.610 --> 02:13.230
This update is available to attache to do I file.

02:13.230 --> 02:19.260
Of course if we go we we've found that updates for the Isak's II 6.5 and so on.

02:19.420 --> 02:24.460
So the different updates is available of course in revetments.

02:24.460 --> 02:32.230
You can just click on download to download a different date available to get the updates from them or

02:32.260 --> 02:35.690
if you don't have a connection there to do the center server.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.520
You can download the defendant's page manually.

02:39.880 --> 02:44.370
Then you import the page manually right here by click on this one.

02:44.440 --> 02:51.520
Then you need to do page file writer to update the different page procedurally in this one.

02:51.520 --> 02:55.930
So how do you get different information about do updates.

02:55.930 --> 02:59.530
Of course you can show parts about it.

02:59.530 --> 03:06.350
For example if we go to explain five like this one for example this one we want to know this one is

03:06.350 --> 03:08.520
about what we click show page.

03:08.570 --> 03:11.090
Did they give you a quick or view about it.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.340
Did it give you this Lankester check.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.740
More details about these updates.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.400
Then day release dates the description for more of our mission see this line.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.520
So here is this link.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.070
These were E6 eyes 6.5 Bache.

03:27.130 --> 03:30.990
Really I do a number of updates etc..

03:31.130 --> 03:36.080
It's about X net tree then information about it.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.840
It's a bug face the Buche.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.330
Civility is important.

03:39.330 --> 03:39.740
That's me.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.640
This is an important update.

03:41.770 --> 03:42.670
To Robert way.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.610
Yes that's me.

03:43.620 --> 03:50.270
It's a quite to reboot the host virtual machine migration or shut down yes that's mean you need to migrate

03:50.270 --> 03:52.910
to your machine or shut down to your machine.

03:52.930 --> 03:59.030
That's because you need to reboot the halls So automatically you need to migrate or shut down the virtual

03:59.030 --> 03:59.680
machine.

03:59.760 --> 04:06.140
But sometimes the host does not need to reboot but the division machine will be shutdown to apply these

04:06.200 --> 04:07.440
updates.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.140
So fix it hardware.

04:09.140 --> 04:12.670
No it's not really but fix the software and glue.

04:12.740 --> 04:16.550
This is the view that would be included and so on and so on.

04:16.550 --> 04:21.660
Shimada Yes but they do it in VM x 3 et cetera.

04:21.890 --> 04:25.070
So any I think we'll find data about it.

04:25.070 --> 04:31.370
For example the driver click right here we check the Web sites and so on and so on.

04:31.370 --> 04:38.990
So if you have internet you simply click download and will download all the data about the updates available

04:39.080 --> 04:41.590
in your environment etc..
