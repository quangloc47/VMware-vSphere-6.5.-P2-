00:00.300 --> 00:02.380
Maintenance mode option that's mean.

00:02.400 --> 00:10.530
Do you want to put the horse into maintenance mode so you seat disable any removable media device connected

00:10.530 --> 00:13.210
to the virtual machine on the horse.

00:15.430 --> 00:20.980
If you remember when we want to make a motion for our vision machine if this virtual machine connected

00:20.980 --> 00:29.680
to a removable media device or a CD driver does not allow you to make our migration so the same if you

00:29.770 --> 00:36.850
want to migrate of virtual machine you chose to automatically disable any other media device to avoid

00:36.940 --> 00:38.570
another of them.

00:38.910 --> 00:44.100
So this option available when you chose does not change the empower states.

00:44.350 --> 00:44.950
That's mean.

00:45.190 --> 00:53.990
When the process of updating different software is X I number one what's happened to the vitriol machine

00:54.030 --> 00:54.480
I've ever.

00:54.540 --> 01:01.830
But I want we chose do not change Davian power state lets me keep the vitriol machine up to state that

01:01.890 --> 01:05.410
it was a victory machine audit of list then bought it off.

01:05.430 --> 01:08.530
If they are bolted on let them pour it on.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.100
So in this case we should.

01:10.100 --> 01:16.530
Is the hide's ability that will make great the virtual machine from that E-6 I hope to do other Isak's

01:16.530 --> 01:17.760
I host.

01:17.760 --> 01:24.600
So in this case we chose the not chance to be in power on then we should disable any removable media

01:24.600 --> 01:32.550
device to avoid the problem of failure of the motion that birthrate and Trillion Monthan smart in case

01:32.580 --> 01:33.220
of fire.

01:33.410 --> 01:38.880
That's mean if phyla happen to migrate between a machine it should give it another try.

01:38.970 --> 01:45.390
After five minutes for the number of city of three every five minutes he would try to purchase Haast

01:45.420 --> 01:49.630
in dimensions mode to start the installation of the new update.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.510
Then we have to respond but your machine doesn't mean it will respond.

01:53.510 --> 02:00.180
It depends which machine you see right here disable any removable device become available so you don't

02:00.180 --> 02:06.800
need to disable mijo from this host because the virtual machine will be suspended or we chose part of

02:06.960 --> 02:07.410
the same.

02:07.410 --> 02:13.470
That's mean it's where the power of the difference is that your machine or just pawn them into the installation

02:13.470 --> 02:15.350
completes and dimension's mode.

02:15.430 --> 02:22.310
The saved then we have enabled Poche remediation of powerit on the XTi.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.300
Another option that we're not going to cover in this course.

02:25.300 --> 02:30.180
If you want to know what does he eat booty toast you make Aqua Axert good.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.420
So it's not important now situation.

02:32.510 --> 02:36.510
Then you have this option save as a default Haast remediation.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.360
That's me when we reinstall a new update.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.620
Again this approach will save it for another restoration.

02:42.620 --> 02:47.450
So we chose save as the default host remediation option so we click next.
