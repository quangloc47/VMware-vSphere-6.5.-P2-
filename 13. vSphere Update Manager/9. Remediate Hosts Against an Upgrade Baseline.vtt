Hello again.

00:02.490 --> 00:07.960
So in new situations when you're complete downloading different updates fine.

00:08.340 --> 00:15.030
Of course in my situation I counsel this process so I don't have to batch file available able.

00:15.120 --> 00:23.540
Then your next step is to apply the update to the difference is I just simply got to do remediate of

00:23.540 --> 00:26.540
course after clicking on the new date.

00:26.840 --> 00:34.320
Then it asks you to select a mediator for the host remediation or for the virtual machine mediation.

00:34.350 --> 00:38.460
This one for the virtual machine and this one for the horse remediation of course.

00:38.460 --> 00:45.990
No we'll start with the host then the different but busline if we took this one it shows you the upgrade

00:46.120 --> 00:49.160
line for the virtual machine you check the virtual machine.

00:49.420 --> 00:57.270
But Adamsville the host we check do your busline knew the one that we have and connected with different

00:57.290 --> 00:58.520
is because I host.

00:58.520 --> 01:05.750
We click next then we select the target he asks I hold that we want to add starved updates on it of

01:05.750 --> 01:14.200
course in any rate environment you select our hosts 10:28 1096 I host and click next.

01:14.300 --> 01:20.030
But in my situation you can for example chose only one or two or three and you want that you want.

01:20.030 --> 01:26.110
So for example we chose out of a day or our costume number of Isak's I host.

01:26.120 --> 01:35.730
So we click next then your remediation I include a dynamic busline the exact list of applicable Poche

01:35.730 --> 01:39.760
might change before it mediates AUKer even if the list got change.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.220
Any parts that you exclude know will not be applied.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.190
So here it shows you the definitive update that's need to be studied.

01:49.250 --> 01:55.810
It takes a host because we selected it because this is the 15 elements should be studied and it show

01:55.810 --> 01:59.240
your days that updates file downloaded or not.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.930
If they are done with it you will see a green arrow right here.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.850
That's me the file is already exists.

02:04.860 --> 02:09.810
If not it shawled past the stage step before the installation.

02:10.140 --> 02:12.120
So of course you can check out the one that you want.

02:12.110 --> 02:13.770
The one that you didn't want didn't.

02:13.830 --> 02:22.350
Next then you trolls ask you don't ask or ignore warning about it responded hard or the voice and not

02:22.350 --> 02:26.580
on God's support via a method that was thought and continue with remediation.

02:26.580 --> 02:26.990
That's me.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.940
If there are upgrade that will not support the VM as files that are stored.

02:33.960 --> 02:40.090
If you have the FS files at the store and upgrade the new upgrade does not support this one.

02:40.140 --> 02:42.150
It will give you an image size that you want.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.020
Do you want to On-Star this upgrade or not.

02:45.030 --> 02:51.930
If you want to install this upgrade and don't care about the VM f that thought you can chose this one

02:51.990 --> 02:57.770
ignored warnings about and supported the hardware device and not supported VM.

02:57.780 --> 03:04.080
But I still Ussel some hardware for example some spew will not be supported in a new version of the

03:04.170 --> 03:11.370
Isak's I do so old one so it will give you a warning that this new version does not support the sick

03:11.370 --> 03:14.460
view that you have or do specific hardware.

03:14.760 --> 03:20.250
So you need to think carefully about these want to ignore the warning about unsupported hardware to

03:20.250 --> 03:21.780
rest and no longer support it.

03:21.820 --> 03:28.590
If it is not at all select the checkbox you should be aware of the functional application of ignoring

03:28.590 --> 03:29.360
the warning.

03:29.430 --> 03:35.310
In certain cases ignoring warnings about unsupported hardware device and no longer supported ediface

03:35.380 --> 03:42.060
that might cause instability instability to abuse the hosts or lack of needed file.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.340
So you should care about this one.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.220
It is highly recommended to check this one to avoid the problem.

03:48.270 --> 03:55.950
Then of course you can specific skidoos time to grant updates in a specification Timet Morakot immediate

03:55.950 --> 04:02.590
schedule Gibbie's a name description and you chose the specific time to wrap this up.

04:04.330 --> 04:09.250
So for example let's do with art like that example at 11 pm.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.670
Do upgrade Winstock.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.410
But of course in your situation you should do it right.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.700
No see the application right.

04:15.710 --> 04:20.120
No so next then unimportant information.

04:20.120 --> 04:20.600
I tell.
