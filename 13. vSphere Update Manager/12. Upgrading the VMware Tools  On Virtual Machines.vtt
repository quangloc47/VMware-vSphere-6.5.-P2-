WEBVTT

00:00.730 --> 00:01.660
Help again.

00:01.900 --> 00:08.950
So after completing the Great of the different ethics I host we we're back to this place you will see

00:09.020 --> 00:13.990
all those dots make it to upgrade become compliant.

00:13.990 --> 00:20.710
You will see about the different tools that substantively On-Star updates will be in this list right

00:20.710 --> 00:21.120
here.

00:21.310 --> 00:27.370
If in your heart that is not how complete the installation successfully you will find this right.

00:27.850 --> 00:35.650
Then if we check in I host my chair will found a model version Id change it from this one.

00:35.650 --> 00:43.210
So a mother of four machines that you should care about when you want to make an update or to E6 I host.

00:43.390 --> 00:49.650
You need to copy this number of the vision the world number of different version.

00:49.860 --> 00:55.990
But number two hypervisor as stated in the house is this number you need to copy this one and see whats

00:55.990 --> 01:00.720
in our documents in are not paid or on specific plays.

01:00.850 --> 01:07.650
When you complete the oscillation and have some error you can't know which version was before you make

01:07.650 --> 01:08.540
that astonishing.

01:08.620 --> 01:12.230
When we complete the operation this number will be changed to unloader.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.950
Well number or will version.

01:15.550 --> 01:19.720
So you should save those number before completing to upgrade.

01:19.890 --> 01:23.840
What the difference is is I host them on another information right.

01:23.860 --> 01:27.430
You can also do the upgrade at the level of the host.

01:27.430 --> 01:34.800
You can go to any Isak's I host you got to update manager and Silex the host Bartsch then you chose

01:34.800 --> 01:42.050
an immediate to complete the astonishment only Abdulahi of the disk I host controls them one by one.

01:42.250 --> 01:47.310
Another information head that when you go to our virtual machine.

01:47.440 --> 01:55.050
Ah VM were truly opthalmic into updates of the different tool or deliver it is a host when you check

01:55.060 --> 02:00.670
a virtual machine you in front to me missiles right here that this machine does not have a tool.

02:00.760 --> 02:07.100
If we check this one like that it should be run in to see the missile return.

02:07.440 --> 02:13.230
You will see a lot to me when I say that the VM which is not on solid in this virtual machine.

02:13.230 --> 02:13.890
Why.

02:13.890 --> 02:23.270
Because in this situation the compression or the scan between the VM were taught inside the virtual

02:23.270 --> 02:23.940
machine.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.390
We can have a different.

02:25.550 --> 02:27.410
We do them what.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.130
India is a host.

02:29.150 --> 02:36.170
So there are some chance between them were true in the host and virtual machine.

02:36.200 --> 02:42.830
And this is unique to update do being what truly in difference a virtual machine of course with the

02:42.830 --> 02:46.870
same you got the updates manager you chose.

02:46.940 --> 02:52.480
VM all updates and immediate do updates in this virtual machine.

02:53.750 --> 02:59.440
Also here you will find information about the version of The View in which all these wanderer's not

02:59.450 --> 03:01.910
have and which to check this one.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.870
How do you see do vision of do.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.420
VM what true is 10 to.

03:08.570 --> 03:13.810
Of course after making updates what you do you will find another number right there.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.090
So this is the information about the word true.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.940
And I bargees

03:23.020 --> 03:29.730
also we can't do with a delivery of the data center so we can't go for them word like this.

03:29.800 --> 03:35.980
And of course we check the different complaints here each of you that's all the are are incompatible

03:36.010 --> 03:39.590
because they do not have an operating system inside it.

03:40.060 --> 03:44.950
You installed a central server and this is our middle machine.

03:45.040 --> 03:50.460
So you can simply click on this one and chose the same process stage page to download the page.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.890
Of course the two should be download downloaded.

03:53.890 --> 03:54.770
I believe it.

03:54.840 --> 04:02.500
If I host then we can simply click remediate and head it's automatically chose a VM via our appliance

04:02.890 --> 04:06.660
then chose the line name next.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.480
There is the difference between machine.

04:08.580 --> 04:09.690
You check them out.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.630
Of course this one is a mirror.

04:11.680 --> 04:19.150
But of course you can install the VM were two sided Did you see great for the true for a different individual

04:19.150 --> 04:27.720
machine one does not have and work through and does one still not have any VM withdrawal etc..

04:27.820 --> 04:31.260
Then you click next day.

04:31.450 --> 04:34.800
Here we have some option name the task description.

04:34.810 --> 04:36.890
The upgrade our power.

04:36.910 --> 04:43.150
That's mean we'll put the upgrade until with power our virtual machine when we powered any of the vision

04:43.150 --> 04:49.310
machine will upgrade to when we're inside a virtual machine when they are bolted on.

04:49.420 --> 04:56.740
Or you can apply to operate at a specific time with power on the virtual machine and install the VM

04:56.740 --> 05:03.730
were all one by one controls specific time foreboded on your machine all the power on your machine in

05:03.730 --> 05:08.590
this time for the part of your machine in this time forces form the virtual machine.

05:08.590 --> 05:09.920
In this time.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.770
Then you click next.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.340
Then what is it.

05:13.390 --> 05:15.220
Option for taking a snapshot.

05:15.220 --> 05:20.950
It is always recommended to take a snapshot of the virtual machine before remediate to enable Rohrbach

05:21.610 --> 05:29.400
then it shows how much time to keep the snapshot for which you put out or do not want to do it manually.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.860
You give a name for the snapshot.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.820
What example.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.660
Snape for updates like that.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.530
The description also have option to take a snapshot of the memory.

05:40.600 --> 05:49.090
It's not important for the update but if you want to get a snapshot of the memory you can chose it then

05:49.320 --> 05:49.940
next.

05:49.990 --> 05:56.750
Again you can't start to upgrade immediately for the different better machine.

05:56.920 --> 06:01.090
So this is the option to make the updates Abdula of the virtual machine.

06:01.150 --> 06:08.160
When you start it it will start updating do different virtual machine to work perfectly.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.210
So this is a different update.

06:10.240 --> 06:15.920
We have Abdula bit of the horse and Adam Levine of the virtual machine.

06:16.090 --> 06:21.090
So I hope that I cover all the important step right here.

06:21.250 --> 06:26.890
If you have any new information that you want to share it with us please share it in the discussion

06:26.890 --> 06:29.560
course and see you in the next VDO.
