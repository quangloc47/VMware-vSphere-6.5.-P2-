WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.560
Then we have and justification check Skidder.

00:02.700 --> 00:08.400
It's a configuration for mitigation of update.

00:08.490 --> 00:17.360
Mynydd send your mitigation in a specific time in about what's do you see a writer enable then we have

00:17.910 --> 00:25.080
the name of the notification every hour and six minutes after letter that's mean when he completes updates

00:25.440 --> 00:32.490
one hour later and six minutes we'll send you on that occasion did you come in to get on that indication

00:32.760 --> 00:35.630
in your email inbox.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.210
Then we have the VM sitting.

00:37.230 --> 00:39.520
It's about a virtual machine.

00:39.520 --> 00:45.080
This one is interation about the VM where you're when you make an updated VM well-drawn.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.850
What do you think that you'll do.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.310
It's take a snapshot of the Diom before remediate to enable rollback.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.650
That's mean when you want to make an update to the true.

00:55.960 --> 01:02.950
It is necessary to take a snapshot to avoid any problem happen drove the VM up to updates because VM

01:02.950 --> 01:06.320
Where is our software when you make an update to that software.

01:06.400 --> 01:15.300
It can crash your operating system or disable the network or anything can happen in your virtual machine.

01:15.340 --> 01:19.900
So it is necessary to take a snapshot for this virtual machine.

01:19.900 --> 01:27.640
If the updates go successfully then you can back and delete those natural or we can config delete the

01:27.680 --> 01:29.530
snapshot after a moment to click.

01:29.580 --> 01:37.310
It did it's true you take a snapshot of the virtual machine before you mediate to enable Rohrbach DeMoss

01:37.370 --> 01:37.800
delayed.

01:37.810 --> 01:45.280
It does not mean after taking a snapshot he will keep this snapshot forever but then you can't change

01:45.280 --> 01:52.400
it to keep it for one note or for example a 6 hour or maybe after 24 hour that's when you are sure that

01:52.450 --> 01:54.930
the updates work successively etc..

01:55.130 --> 01:58.570
So it is always want it to the latest nuptials.

01:58.570 --> 02:07.270
After a moment of weight costumey size every time you make an update didn't we have the house and cluster

02:07.290 --> 02:10.920
stitching the different stitching for the cluster.

02:10.920 --> 02:17.730
This is the default setting but of course you can change the city from the E6 I has an example where

02:17.810 --> 02:25.200
we are low on installation of additional software disable to hide operability other mission control

02:25.200 --> 02:25.830
by default.

02:25.830 --> 02:33.320
It's not because it will keep the hides of ability when an updates happen to the host when updates happen.

02:33.460 --> 02:38.670
With a load has to retry in maintenance mode in case of Filer that's me.

02:38.700 --> 02:45.380
If something wrong happen to update put the horse into mountainous mode it changes true yes that's mean.

02:45.420 --> 02:49.780
David your machine in the hall should be evacuated to another host.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.430
This is the root of the site that will reboot.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.510
Does your machine in another host.

02:54.600 --> 03:01.390
But sometimes you need to change this option to yes to disable to hide ability.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.240
For example you have a smart environment.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.970
In addition we have only three halls.

03:06.090 --> 03:13.970
If something happened to one of those House and the entry in the maintenance mode the other host country

03:13.980 --> 03:18.030
report the virtual machine of the host so we'd have a problem in the situation.

03:18.060 --> 03:21.830
So we need to disable to hide our ability in this situation.

03:21.930 --> 03:28.820
Then we have to be updating it's in question about the app that we talk about it's smart to reboot after

03:28.830 --> 03:29.670
remediate.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.750
That's mean when it completes the installation of the update.

03:33.810 --> 03:38.910
You need to start a reboot for the virtual machine in the app.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.520
This is the default option.

03:40.550 --> 03:48.040
And next we're going to try to make some editing and updates for a different level.

03:48.500 --> 03:48.860
To be.
