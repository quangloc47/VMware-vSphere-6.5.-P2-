WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:07.290
Then a modern formation about do cluster remediation option is secretaire to the immediate cluster.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.110
First you should Thumper's exhibits certain cluster future.

00:11.270 --> 00:11.680
That's mean.

00:11.690 --> 00:20.640
We need to disable some future in the cluster to make to remediate Update Manager automatically.

00:20.650 --> 00:23.180
Reenable do a future after remediation.

00:23.180 --> 00:31.620
So when we chose disable any option after the installation of the updates it will automatically enable

00:31.620 --> 00:33.420
those future later.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.670
So Update Manager does not remediate host or cross-talk on we should have.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.280
You should probably enable it.

00:40.360 --> 00:49.350
I mean if the future is Zebley in our specific hosts then we chose to disable for example default prevalence

00:49.400 --> 00:54.320
in our host when he finished the installation or to upgrade.

00:54.650 --> 01:01.920
He will try to enable the filters again but in a specific cost that we are loaded to deserves the full

01:02.290 --> 01:10.460
force inside its updates it will not going to change the status of that Isak's I host because we already

01:10.610 --> 01:12.170
use it manually.

01:12.170 --> 01:15.530
This is for the height of ability and other option.

01:16.070 --> 01:18.930
So we have disabled distributed power management.

01:19.030 --> 01:22.070
It is enabled for any of the six in the cluster.

01:22.280 --> 01:29.630
If we put an option of the power management that any hosts have a zero virtual machine it should be

01:29.630 --> 01:30.570
powered at all.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.350
So we need to disable this option to complete the astonishment process.

01:35.360 --> 01:42.510
If we check this one and one of the hosts have the option to power off when we have zero load them.

01:42.620 --> 01:48.410
So when he tried to evacuate all the vitriol machine from the toaster put it in dimension and smoke

01:49.030 --> 01:54.520
the automatic and we will shut down and the oscillation of the update will not when we talk.

01:54.560 --> 02:01.930
So by default we shall disable do power management the distributive power management then we have these

02:02.210 --> 02:03.620
false alarms.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.600
This one you should visit the filterless for the house to avoid a problem.

02:08.610 --> 02:14.650
This were not going to make you in problem this fix all fault runs between machine into the cluster.

02:14.750 --> 02:20.630
If your late updates manager disable filterless when necessary you should remediate all the hosts in

02:20.630 --> 02:24.230
a cluster so that the host remain consistent.

02:24.230 --> 02:28.200
This wife will can be re-inhabit absent remediation.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.900
Then we have deserved the height of ability.

02:30.980 --> 02:36.200
It is sometimes Kamandi to disable the heights of ability to avoid some problem.

02:36.260 --> 02:42.620
If you remember I told you that when he tried to evacuate the virtual machine from that host sometimes

02:42.890 --> 02:48.000
the other host Konst reported Alda's virtual machine so it will have on these two.

02:48.050 --> 02:53.390
In this case you need to disable the highs of ability and make the upgrade.

02:53.420 --> 03:00.190
Then you enable it again then enable Perata remediation for the host in the selected cluster.

03:00.320 --> 03:00.910
That's me.

03:01.040 --> 03:08.240
You make the upgrade for two or three Haast at the same times so automatically determine the maximum

03:08.240 --> 03:10.230
number of concurrent and immediate cost.

03:10.250 --> 03:17.450
In a cluster in this case if you have a large number of the Isak's I host and you leave has agreed to

03:17.510 --> 03:18.570
enable it.

03:18.850 --> 03:23.720
It will check how much post-concert for a virtual machine.

03:23.720 --> 03:33.500
Then if it can't that he can migrate the vitriol machine from tree a house and all division machine

03:33.830 --> 03:40.640
can't power it on in the other ESX I house available here when boot free I host into maintenance mode

03:40.910 --> 03:45.750
and styled installation at the same times for the tree is a house.

03:45.860 --> 03:53.400
If he can't find any resource available to migrate to spiritual machine it will make it and then see

03:53.450 --> 03:58.660
how much as a host can be put it into mundaneness more to make to upgrade.

03:58.860 --> 04:03.550
So it would calculate the number of the holes can be supported.

04:04.050 --> 04:06.980
Pretty independent small to make the remediate.

04:06.980 --> 04:14.550
Or you can chose the number that you want by how much house can be twisted into madness mode and astonishment

04:14.580 --> 04:15.040
started.

04:15.050 --> 04:21.440
Of course logically you can't put for example a 5 and you have only to my house limit the number of

04:21.500 --> 04:23.950
concurrent and immediate halt in each cluster.

04:23.990 --> 04:28.790
Each cluster should be limited by four holes for the top.

04:28.850 --> 04:35.880
If you have thousands of easy holes and you want to make an upgrade for the difference is I hope you

04:35.880 --> 04:38.910
put a limit number of holes Tuscumbia.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.580
Put it into mountainous mode and start the astonishment.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.200
See always.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.970
It is a comedy trick.

04:45.020 --> 04:52.750
Or if for example in any reason you want to keep for example more than 99 percent of the E6 I hosts

04:52.790 --> 04:59.840
available you chose a limit number right there negate spouted off and she spent between two other holes

04:59.840 --> 05:00.460
in the cluster.

05:00.470 --> 05:04.090
If a host must enter Menton and smot this option.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.510
It's like the Hydes.

05:05.510 --> 05:09.740
I would really take the highs with the work with the departed on boojum machine and this option will

05:09.740 --> 05:13.460
let you to immigrate do about it of virtual machine.

05:13.460 --> 05:21.430
Also from I host to another host to avoid any problem happen to that you keep your virtual machine because

05:21.550 --> 05:24.450
it's in a modern Isak's I host.

05:24.650 --> 05:31.880
Then the same save for the default setting then next then it'll give you a quick overview to start the

05:31.880 --> 05:32.740
installation.

05:32.740 --> 05:37.920
So this is a different step to start the updates of it.

05:38.150 --> 05:44.470
Hulst when we click Finish here will start downloading the different updates and start applying them

05:44.740 --> 05:48.290
after putting the difference in dimensions.

05:48.600 --> 05:54.040
So this process will take a lot of time in my situation so I will conciliate and you can't do it in

05:54.040 --> 05:56.600
your home lab within the next three.
