WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:08.370
Then we have the horses bus lane where we have to post busline calorie exists all already predefine

00:08.390 --> 00:09.390
and that's mean.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.780
Those come to be edited or deleted.

00:12.850 --> 00:22.030
It's by default created by the VM Where does one get you the noncritical host page and the critical

00:22.380 --> 00:24.020
Spaight redefine it.

00:24.180 --> 00:32.240
That's mean different content that exists in this one and composite to do different tasks you have in

00:32.240 --> 00:35.280
your environment to check if there are any updates.

00:35.330 --> 00:44.810
In our environment we have one line for non-critical hosts updates available and 65 critical Hulst updates

00:44.840 --> 00:45.450
available.

00:45.620 --> 00:51.520
You click on it it will see the details about the different update that we should use of course.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.710
You see right there if we check the different updates we can use.

00:58.820 --> 01:07.470
Of course he gets all the updates for 6 5 4 5 and 6 6.5 if we check right there is 6.5.

01:07.520 --> 01:12.140
So we have only just update that we should use in our environments.

01:12.140 --> 01:20.770
Aldo's forsakes and the 5.5 as we don't have any house running under 6 1 0 or 5 4 5.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.650
So we don't need to update you others.

01:23.690 --> 01:30.500
But of course you need it when you start any host or other shit holes.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.690
In this the center server that's hard to do is x.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.960
I fly plant five.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.800
Then of course we can create a house line.

01:38.870 --> 01:42.820
It's like when you create a hospital fight.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.720
No we have a host busline.

01:44.900 --> 01:52.400
You give it a name for example new one then description then you chose to create a house patch or a

01:52.400 --> 01:54.860
house extension or a house upgrade.

01:55.070 --> 02:02.090
Let's chals with the patch then you chose fix it or the unique fix it does mean you would put a specific

02:02.200 --> 02:05.210
date but never updates them but dynamic.

02:05.240 --> 02:11.060
They will be updated automatically if there are any available page then you click next.

02:11.180 --> 02:18.700
It's secure to get and you wonder if you'll check our fate available in our But repository we have the

02:18.700 --> 02:22.550
same way where products and Cisco Systems products.

02:22.550 --> 02:27.380
So for example where we chose any last minute Alda on board or for example you want to get only the

02:27.380 --> 02:30.050
updates from the VM when we chose this one.

02:30.170 --> 02:37.970
Or if we are for example some Cisco switch or hardware we add so it's and we had the product that we

02:38.120 --> 02:40.360
want to use and get updates from it.

02:40.360 --> 02:45.770
So it draws any Then we chose critical and important like that.

02:46.160 --> 02:52.880
Of course it is recommended use is critical in a portal and it's not necessary to use the moderates

02:52.940 --> 03:01.020
and low updates because it's not necessary to always update your environment for a low severity update

03:01.250 --> 03:08.240
because sometimes can destroy your environments sort of which is too low and moderately into you are

03:08.270 --> 03:12.100
sure that you want to get a low updates D-New enable this one.

03:12.260 --> 03:17.900
So if your girl chose critical and important like this one then it shows the release date of the update.

03:17.900 --> 03:26.780
For example if you have an update for the 2017 You can chose only do 2000 18 update of wait over downloading

03:26.870 --> 03:28.790
of the different updates available.

03:29.150 --> 03:35.830
Then the category if you want get some kind of security or a bug fixed or enhancements or any etc..

03:36.050 --> 03:38.650
Then you click next.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.500
Then you have patch to exclude.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.790
This is different.

03:42.870 --> 03:45.810
Birch that's available from the updates.

03:45.810 --> 03:46.090
Right.

03:46.090 --> 03:51.990
No he check the network and to get those updates then it shows you the different updates are available

03:52.050 --> 03:52.850
and head.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.020
These are the Bertsch matching to dynamic busline critical dynamic that we chose.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.860
But in this step right there.

04:01.340 --> 04:05.910
But for chaws only see scoop it will show only for option 10.

04:05.970 --> 04:12.690
But when we chose any or only VM what it will show us a lot of updates available then if you want to

04:12.690 --> 04:16.510
exclude some of this update we need to check it.

04:16.530 --> 04:21.780
So you see Silex the one that you want to permanently exclude from this bus line.

04:21.870 --> 04:27.350
So we in chick Aldo's one we leave them in check so we want to get all these updates.

04:27.430 --> 04:34.790
We click next then if we want to add some additional part there is our page not matching the dynamic

04:34.810 --> 04:41.730
busline critiquer Silex to Dujuan permanently and Kloot into dynamic busline detect that this one does

04:41.730 --> 04:49.780
not exist in the bass line so we can take them to other them to the bass line if we want or not then.

04:49.820 --> 04:52.900
Next this is a quick overview finish.

04:52.980 --> 04:58.810
So we create our new busline for our hosts so seemed a be the.
