00:01.740 --> 00:09.240
Hello and welcome in this new section we're going to discover another New York futures of deam when

00:09.690 --> 00:18.030
in distinction we're going to cover do heights of ability or we call it h h h h or the.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.470
Height of humidity.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.950
So what is this fair height of obesity.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.080
The purpose of this fair height and ability is very simple.

00:28.080 --> 00:34.580
Of course the first condition that you need to have two Isak's I host the minimum you should have three

00:34.580 --> 00:34.880
or six.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.870
I host the height of a meal if you want to work only with what ESX I host.

00:40.950 --> 00:49.320
So the requirement is to have two E6 I host and of course we need to have a cluster to be able to do

00:49.410 --> 00:54.810
height of ability as you do in the previous section from now to talk with us.

00:54.810 --> 01:00.300
We're going to do need to have a cluster before getting this option.

01:00.300 --> 01:07.610
So for example we have two years I host and we have Vitry and a machine that's run in do is.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.780
I Hulst number one.

01:08.780 --> 01:16.980
For example this is X I host and we use a virtual machine that for example have active duty or exchange

01:16.980 --> 01:21.010
or any sort risk or application in your company.

01:21.300 --> 01:26.760
In a case that's something wrong happened to the host.

01:26.790 --> 01:35.280
This is I Haast for example have a filer or up or down or anything else that make this I host out of

01:35.280 --> 01:37.260
service automatically.

01:37.410 --> 01:40.990
This virtual machine will be out of service.

01:41.100 --> 01:47.220
This virtual machine that is running in this host and for example someone in plug the cable of the power

01:47.220 --> 01:48.120
to this host.

01:48.180 --> 01:53.240
So automatically it's like you unplug the power cable of this machine.

01:53.340 --> 01:56.810
So this machine is out of service right now.

01:57.300 --> 02:06.120
But in the case that we do this fear of everything what would happen this machine will be rebooted in

02:06.270 --> 02:08.270
another host like that.

02:08.280 --> 02:14.370
So you see this machine after it for example to put three minutes this machine would be powered on in

02:14.370 --> 02:16.130
this Haast or I-10.

02:16.350 --> 02:21.770
So this is do purpose of do this fear heights of mobility.

02:22.470 --> 02:25.860
So next we'll discover more details about of.
