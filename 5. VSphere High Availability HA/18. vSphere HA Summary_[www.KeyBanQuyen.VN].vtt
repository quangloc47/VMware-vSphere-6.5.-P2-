00:02.310 --> 00:03.280
Hello again.

00:03.380 --> 00:09.950
So if you go back to the State of the heights of ability if you remember this state right.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.520
No we have a house connected to the master.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.790
We have only one.

00:13.820 --> 00:20.730
This one that still work and is not connected to muster is one the one that's have our Freiler.

00:20.780 --> 00:26.780
So the situation right here is a host by luck and not on network is or isn't if we have only a network

00:26.780 --> 00:30.860
installation from that one we'll get information right there.

00:31.070 --> 00:38.440
But as we have hosts file or the hoses out of service totally because we part of the house.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.210
So you see the situation right.

00:40.730 --> 00:42.390
Then some other information.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.080
Either that or the situation of eats in the right environment and you see that we have seven virtual

00:48.080 --> 00:49.470
machines still protected.

00:49.460 --> 00:52.290
That's I mean our our virtual machine worked perfectly.

00:52.340 --> 00:53.940
Even we have a host.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.370
Out of service.

00:55.670 --> 00:58.770
So no I will try to put one on the six.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.900
I Halston but it took me two.

01:02.060 --> 01:07.970
It will detect that the host is Boxford a lot and all operatically know that the press will take action

01:07.970 --> 01:16.810
to get our balance restored between the different hosts and we'll see some real emotion right had happened.

01:16.910 --> 01:21.950
So let's back return and try to see what would happen.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.360
When do I do box to do work.

01:27.020 --> 01:30.540
You have here not responding because it's still out of service.

01:30.710 --> 01:31.280
No.

01:31.460 --> 01:39.080
I asked him to power on he start the process of power and he will take a little time and we'll be back

01:39.080 --> 01:40.620
to the live.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.900
Of course how do you see that the memory is for you.

01:44.070 --> 01:44.950
That's mean.

01:45.090 --> 01:49.940
He denied the memory of the one uses by this is because I host.

01:50.060 --> 01:58.610
So we have this one here 11 and this one have four gigabytes so it is fourteen point sixty seven.

01:58.940 --> 02:05.270
So no it's work perfectly and we'll wait a little time until the Vicent of service detects that the

02:05.270 --> 02:15.020
host is excited to box with a light bite send it in her debate and see if the host responded.

02:15.030 --> 02:23.520
So as you see the I host back to the live a little time this newscast we are gone automatically and

02:23.820 --> 02:27.550
from the motion will be start automatically.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.690
Let's see what will happen.

02:29.790 --> 02:32.400
So it does give you a little time in to do.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.520
Test and the cluster Niek is on calculation to take the necessary action.

02:38.560 --> 02:38.900
Quite

02:49.870 --> 02:56.580
so as you see after refreshing the person he takes it to a new one and capacity to take up a positive

02:56.790 --> 02:58.630
Richard 18 gigabytes.

02:58.750 --> 03:02.890
It's set up to spew out and other things.

03:02.980 --> 03:08.720
If we Boxter the monitoring and you get dressed you see that Haast connected is to.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.540
And we have zero file option.

03:11.650 --> 03:17.320
So the number two back to life if we check the hostile battle anti-veteran mushy.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.120
It's still a..

03:19.120 --> 03:21.880
Defn Not use any virtual machine.

03:21.880 --> 03:27.190
No it's time for the rest to control and check the information.

03:27.340 --> 03:33.630
If we go right ahead and let's make the DNS run know to get the decision.

03:33.630 --> 03:43.450
So the details are refresh the cluster to get new information and we'll see what will be happen after

03:44.350 --> 03:47.520
a moment.

03:47.590 --> 03:55.840
So the house number two did not have any between machine Isak's I one have all the to get your machine

03:56.620 --> 04:01.750
do you six i3 the muster want host Ald. other virtual machine.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.580
Of course we have a nice suit right.

04:09.430 --> 04:15.210
Of do is X einen Vertrag have a powerful see you but it is x.

04:15.220 --> 04:21.820
I want to have an old version of the Sibiu when a virtual machine used this one.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.640
He can't migrate it and use an old version of the virtual machine.

04:26.740 --> 04:35.920
And that's really an issue for our center and that's why we need to do EVC configuration in this situation

04:36.110 --> 04:42.190
to LIT's the cluster use the similar C-p between the different virtual machine.

04:42.190 --> 04:49.090
So we'll talk about this point later but in our situation those machines will be integrated to this

04:49.090 --> 04:52.240
one soon to next be.
