00:00.390 --> 00:05.470
So then you have Lust's one option right here is about look what you see.

00:05.670 --> 00:10.260
This one is the same as the cluster resources department that's right here about 10 years.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.140
Do you see this list that you define it.

00:13.150 --> 00:14.740
Ozdemir and stupid.

00:14.780 --> 00:20.090
Does that satisfy the reservation requirements for any powerit on that machine in the cluster.

00:20.640 --> 00:30.610
So the idea right here is that he will take the big vitrine machine that cost you do most resouce.

00:30.630 --> 00:38.780
So for example if you have a hosts that have a gigabyte or fine 10 we have different virtual machine

00:38.780 --> 00:45.560
inside that host the one that's consumed the big resouce for example of a machine that can stream for

00:45.690 --> 00:46.830
gigabytes offering.

00:46.970 --> 00:50.910
So the slot calculated will be for bytes over time.

00:50.990 --> 00:57.610
Then the you the most that concern to hide Sibiu will be our slot number.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.990
So they will make its own calculation.

01:00.090 --> 01:08.360
Do number of slots for the most big virtual machine thats me.

01:08.500 --> 01:17.530
When he found that Hulst number one example just has to have for virtual machine and one of the virtual

01:17.530 --> 01:24.890
machine thats consumed for about offering the other three Mushin can only do it over.

01:25.030 --> 01:33.010
So do Sloat will be 4G gobshites of frame as you said MMRDA slot size is 1 megabytes and it will be

01:33.040 --> 01:40.870
4 gigabytes of reme so it will make its own question about the slot he would reserve for example to

01:40.900 --> 01:48.490
slot in a host thats me in his situation happened wrong in this host that have the virtual machine thats

01:48.510 --> 01:55.280
consumed parting advice offering it will automatically have a free slot in another host.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.140
Thats me.

01:56.140 --> 02:00.610
Our free resource that's required for you got bytes of RAM.

02:00.670 --> 02:12.020
Minimum in just region he raises our resource that can support the most big virtual machine in the environment.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.000
I mean it is the creation Hoppen rank.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.840
We have the big virtual machine.

02:17.050 --> 02:21.500
We have our space that's counterpart this virtual machine in another horse.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.270
It's Meeke do a calculation about the slot to the cemetery you see the difference that we have.

02:27.490 --> 02:32.860
How much memory you can't customize this one for example 20 etc..

02:33.010 --> 02:37.990
So when you make a calculation he will show you that this machine can't support this lot.

02:37.990 --> 02:42.500
Does one need two slots in what is right here is one it talks a lot.

02:42.610 --> 02:48.130
So it's a little complex in the Star How does slot work you can make a quick search for Google about

02:48.220 --> 02:51.660
two slots and you will get a lot of examples.

02:51.730 --> 02:58.910
You have two types of lots of calculation and you will get our explanation about how the slots be calculated.

02:59.140 --> 03:04.630
But the idea here is about the big virtual machine you know resource use it.

03:04.750 --> 03:09.930
So next we see do performance degradation Virtual Machine Tools see in the next expect.
