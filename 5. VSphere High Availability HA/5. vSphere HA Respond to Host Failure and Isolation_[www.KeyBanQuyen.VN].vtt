WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.320
So we got your eyes right.

00:02.730 --> 00:07.510
And we click it to it on.

00:07.530 --> 00:13.890
So when we do on this fear heights of ability we have another option right there but we're going to

00:13.890 --> 00:15.100
see it later.

00:15.540 --> 00:19.830
But no it's concentrate only on this fear or repeat.

00:19.860 --> 00:26.400
So as you see here when we turn on the VCR I really think it's too hot and hostile fire at the level

00:26.460 --> 00:27.640
of the host.

00:27.660 --> 00:34.950
So when we have a host by a lot what we should do it should restart the VM restart being using DMA is

00:34.950 --> 00:37.040
part priority order.

00:37.530 --> 00:41.010
So this is the rule that's going to use.

00:41.250 --> 00:45.750
So let's get and see some options that we have in do.

00:45.850 --> 00:46.130
Right.

00:46.150 --> 00:48.390
And reality one by one.

00:48.450 --> 00:56.970
So the first one filer and response you can config how we spend heyes audibility response to the final

00:57.090 --> 01:02.120
condition on this cluster the full filer condition are supported.

01:02.260 --> 01:06.660
Haast that means the first one is the host then host Israelian.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.750
If you remember the host is relation like Mustard's league.

01:10.830 --> 01:19.540
The VM component protection datastore we'd be n and ADP then Duveen and application.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.240
So let's discover them one by one.

01:22.240 --> 01:29.560
Of course if we disable enabling host monitor of course we only have to do it via monitoring when we're

01:29.620 --> 01:31.210
active to hide.

01:31.270 --> 01:33.960
Will it work at the level of the host.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.450
And you see all this option is desirable only the host file response that have enabled we have disable

01:40.540 --> 01:41.660
and enable.

01:41.830 --> 01:47.880
Of course if we make disable that mean we disable the heights of ability.

01:48.040 --> 01:55.900
So we need to make it enable to get to do benefits of the height of it.

01:55.960 --> 02:02.760
But when we checked this one no we have to hide our ability at the level of the virtual machine.

02:02.890 --> 02:03.430
That's me.

02:03.460 --> 02:10.130
It will track the virtual machine only vim monitoring only the them and application monitoring.

02:10.170 --> 02:10.830
Love it.

02:10.840 --> 02:17.320
If you remember I told do that I heard a bit from Master hostel sleve house.

02:17.410 --> 02:21.280
Then we have also I heard the beat to do virtual machine.

02:21.280 --> 02:27.150
Also we have I heard the application Indu vitriol machine.

02:27.290 --> 02:29.710
We're going to talk about it a little.

02:30.220 --> 02:38.140
But as always this is like most other windsock like extremely other and so you should check carefully

02:38.140 --> 02:43.180
when you use this one because you will get a lot lot of other in your environment.

02:43.180 --> 02:50.300
So this is very very advanced and you should be attention to work with it.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.700
So of course we work we do Haast monitoring and we have house fire response.

02:56.860 --> 03:04.470
If we click on it to get more details we have two option are low you config host monitoring and fall

03:04.480 --> 03:06.140
over on this cluster.

03:06.400 --> 03:13.770
So the first one is disable lets mean we disable the horse trading day hostel which is journey of where

03:13.820 --> 03:16.170
the center will not respond to the host by an hour.

03:16.390 --> 03:23.300
When we chose this one if one of the host gets a fire look at the height of when not do anything.

03:23.500 --> 03:29.980
But of course logically the height of ability should restart the virtual machine inside another available

03:30.130 --> 03:30.860
host.

03:30.880 --> 03:40.330
So we chose Wistar VM with a host Finder is detected VM will be restarted in order determinates by did

03:40.440 --> 03:41.680
restart priority.

03:41.680 --> 03:48.040
Of course they will restart the virtual machine but will take a priority order to restart the virtual

03:48.040 --> 03:49.690
machine inside the stores.

03:49.840 --> 03:57.820
As we talked before some mushy issues about it own Firstly they say the machine should be powered later.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.940
For example the active their potential departed on the desk spacially to be voted on to give the IP

04:03.940 --> 04:07.860
address for the different server the DNS etc..

04:07.990 --> 04:11.610
Then we have some application that connected to that other bus.

04:11.610 --> 04:17.760
For example the database virtual machine should be powered on first then the application connected to

04:17.760 --> 04:20.490
just the babies should be powered later.

04:20.590 --> 04:28.210
So what he ultimately chose Dooke order determinates by dear redstart priority from different tasks.

04:29.110 --> 04:37.090
Then we have the option default VM restart the routine we chose between medium lowest and hightest.

04:37.090 --> 04:45.460
You chose the restart Petrucci should take the restart priority as hightest as will or should use the

04:45.580 --> 04:57.190
last one and then power start boated on one by one then we have VM dependency restart condition this

04:57.730 --> 05:06.870
option Itek is in rotation about do virtual machine in the House do restart condition.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.060
We see right where it used the resource allocated.

05:10.110 --> 05:15.090
That's mean he will restart the virtual machine in a condition of the resource.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.170
Then we have our own guests had to be detected.

05:19.170 --> 05:26.880
That's mean he sent ahead to be to do operation system order every your machine and this heart beats

05:27.930 --> 05:30.040
use it by the VM where.

05:30.190 --> 05:35.630
And in the previous course I told you that's a DVM where truth is unnecessary software.

05:35.880 --> 05:42.500
Every virtual machine created in your environment automatically you should still do VM withdrawal.

05:42.510 --> 05:47.240
So does that mean we're all give you all look a lot of benefits.

05:47.370 --> 05:55.680
And one of them is the Hertz bits between the virtual machine and the cluster that manage those virtual

05:55.680 --> 06:02.800
machine didn't have the level of the application we detected to help it's up to a patient system the

06:02.970 --> 06:06.490
application as valid inside the operating system.

06:06.570 --> 06:08.280
Also have a heartbeat.

06:08.430 --> 06:16.200
This one is more than that and we don't use it only if we have some huge environment.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.900
And the priority of every virtual machine etc..

06:20.190 --> 06:26.210
So this is something extremely sick but we always use resource allocated.

06:26.370 --> 06:30.190
But let's get a quick overview about the different one.

06:30.270 --> 06:34.260
So when we chose restos allocated here work automatically and deceit.

06:34.470 --> 06:41.780
When we start a virtual machine when we chose Bharath own that's mean we in the first virtual machine

06:41.920 --> 06:46.180
it on to go to the second one and it on.

06:46.290 --> 06:52.740
Then when the Stigand want posted on here we've got to do it don't sit up he don't get about this.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.100
This machine completes the power process or not.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.700
He will start powering on one by one.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.910
Then we have the guests head a bit deducted.

07:03.060 --> 07:03.640
That's me.

07:03.750 --> 07:10.410
When he powered the first machine of course all this actually happened when a horse gets filed.

07:11.260 --> 07:19.450
When a horse is out of service you will start rebooting the virtual machine exists in that host.

07:19.450 --> 07:26.430
In other hosts with this condition this gets hurt bit detected.

07:26.710 --> 07:27.900
That's me.

07:28.950 --> 07:34.060
The second group or virtual machine because we create some group for example the group number one.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.410
Number two didn't do group number three.

07:36.540 --> 07:44.120
Restarting the group number for the first group in the toast will be powered on.

07:44.400 --> 07:52.200
And then when he did text that the operating system in that first machine or that first group of machine

07:52.380 --> 07:57.560
powered on it will send our heart beats to the operating system.

07:57.740 --> 08:04.680
When the system respond that yes the operating system is powered on perfectly and no problem detected

08:05.150 --> 08:12.840
then it will start bolted on the second machine or the second group of machine that showed started at

08:12.890 --> 08:15.120
the second priority.

08:15.630 --> 08:22.010
So for that use do her best to detect if the operating system is bolted on.

08:22.020 --> 08:28.960
And of course he to white angel to get the head beat when he power a virtual machine.

08:29.030 --> 08:33.760
He gets about 600 SIGINT to get.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.430
I heard.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.650
When we powered the first machine.

08:36.690 --> 08:40.680
He weighs about six hundred six and we tend heard the beat.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.590
If he gets the head start powering the ticket machine.

08:45.750 --> 08:51.620
If he does not get in your head it's after six hundred.

08:51.630 --> 08:57.270
Second it will automatically go to the second machine and bought on because it is illegibly true way

08:57.270 --> 09:07.500
to the first machine to put it on and all the upcoming machine state both of which do get hurt.

09:07.710 --> 09:14.850
So for that he automatically ignored the beads from the first match your machine and the go to the stick

09:14.870 --> 09:16.690
do and then pour it on.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.890
Give it a 600 second.

09:19.110 --> 09:25.020
If he does not get in a head to beat he would go to the third one if he gets a heart it's only after

09:25.020 --> 09:29.260
one minute he will start to do one and so on and so on.

09:29.400 --> 09:36.510
And the same for do of her beats for example if you add at the base server in the first group and up

09:36.540 --> 09:43.230
server in a second group in this situation for example is somebody a machine for the database and the

09:43.230 --> 09:46.300
second video machine for the server.

09:46.710 --> 09:49.800
That's connected with the database of a server.

09:49.830 --> 09:55.600
We'll wait till the database is up and running with a heartbeat.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.380
That's mean when hit power on the virtual machine.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.770
That's how the database.

09:59.870 --> 10:01.970
He didn't give it a six hundred.

10:02.010 --> 10:04.080
So good to get.

10:04.110 --> 10:09.870
I heard tweets from the application of the database not only to open it and then know he will wait to

10:09.870 --> 10:13.830
do application to be ready to respond.

10:13.860 --> 10:16.240
That is when you power a virtual machine.

10:16.770 --> 10:21.400
The operating system parted and then the database start work.

10:21.480 --> 10:26.460
After one or two minutes it will take time to read this application.

10:26.460 --> 10:33.960
When this application powered on and ready to use it it will send a heartbeat to do cluster.

10:33.970 --> 10:34.670
That's yes.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.040
The application is ready for work.

10:38.140 --> 10:47.130
Then will star power and on the second virtual machine about a do up server that is that database.

10:47.790 --> 10:54.740
But of course also in some reason system enables to get the head to be application server.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.490
We're waiting for 600 segment before it start.

10:58.560 --> 11:04.200
If something wrong happened to do that base and there's not a stand in a debates here will automatically

11:04.260 --> 11:06.160
wait after 600 sick.

11:06.360 --> 11:11.520
Then he will power on the stick and the virtual machine or the second group of it through the machine.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.880
So this is the idea about this option.

11:14.040 --> 11:19.500
Of course we use the resources allocated because just head to bits and obligacion had to beat something

11:19.560 --> 11:26.220
other than extremely others and you need to have open them and the application but do read about it

11:26.220 --> 11:28.590
on it starts one by one.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.500
Then it is allocated.

11:30.570 --> 11:36.010
You know if there are more space to bolt on a modern military machine if for example power.

11:36.060 --> 11:41.790
The first virtual machine the industry can do what they want to power on the machine but the resellers

11:41.910 --> 11:51.020
in the other host does not support the Turing machine so he will stop at only those ones that have results.

11:51.060 --> 11:53.240
So this is the different option that we are.

11:53.340 --> 11:56.640
And next we'll see the other options we see in the next video.
