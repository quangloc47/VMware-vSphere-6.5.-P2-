WEBVTT

00:02.930 --> 00:03.680
Blogging.

00:03.810 --> 00:07.950
So let's get a real example of do this be a height of everything.

00:08.100 --> 00:13.800
So I pouted on some virtual machine to start migrating something into and machine but I canceled them

00:14.100 --> 00:17.560
because we won't do this besides of ability right now.

00:17.790 --> 00:24.230
So be it the despair height or ability we enable the this.

00:24.260 --> 00:29.600
I mean Britney of course we don't need to use the proxy because we do not have the blog monitoring.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.590
So it was only to find out I really do find a response.

00:33.620 --> 00:40.590
We're going to chose a rock star or power off and then restart the virtual machine then restart your

00:40.590 --> 00:44.430
machine with the information the same as it is.

00:44.430 --> 00:49.900
Of course we do not have the proxy to admission control we leave it as the default to head to beat.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.420
We leave it as automatically then do other than that option.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.840
We don't have any one.

00:54.990 --> 01:01.850
So when we clear on the Visby that we click OK and the is x.

01:01.900 --> 01:09.500
I will start to be configured for the Vista I want you see E6 I want configuration of this view as it

01:09.790 --> 01:11.840
is x I treat and is x.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.100
I too will be configured for the height.

01:16.520 --> 01:24.100
It will take a little time and we start seeing some information after enabling Bespin hides.

01:24.520 --> 01:32.630
So I'm a great veteran machine from East excitatory and i3 because summer there is information.

01:32.680 --> 01:38.670
So we just wait until the end of 2 on the creation of the height of the industry.

01:38.710 --> 01:46.320
Of course this function happened to Ald Isak's I holes in your environment so no config is x.

01:46.330 --> 01:54.000
I do work with the hide ability also hate config the different tools to chose one master and other slave

01:54.150 --> 01:54.860
etc..

01:56.140 --> 01:57.790
So I'll just give it a little time.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.650
Ancient and of dysfunction

02:02.490 --> 02:03.450
so what is it.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.230
No I'll do it.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.710
I configured it.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.650
Jews did this to of ability.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.320
Everything is OK.

02:10.590 --> 02:16.650
Then we can see the information about the heights of ability of this one.

02:16.650 --> 02:23.290
So to get an idea about what happened after the configuration of the house we got to cluster of course.

02:23.380 --> 02:29.420
And in the military we have another tape called the spear height of EPD Sunni.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.250
Click on it.

02:30.270 --> 02:37.290
We get a summary about the different information about it so you see he automatically chose the mustard

02:37.630 --> 02:38.980
caused E6.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.460
But treat him.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.590
It's our calculation and decided that the muster is do you think I number three.

02:45.630 --> 02:46.000
Why.

02:46.020 --> 02:53.940
Because I know you have 11 gigabytes of room and board full speed so I to see that is x number three

02:54.090 --> 02:58.910
will be do muster then we have hosts connected to muster.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.810
We have two house.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.880
If you see we have just one master.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.780
How much was connected to do most.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.310
We have to E6 I host.

03:07.500 --> 03:16.140
So if we have 10 I host one will be mustered and then we have my host connected to muster.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.430
Then we have host not connected to muster.

03:18.450 --> 03:20.210
That's a that's have a problem.

03:20.430 --> 03:24.360
To be connected with the muster that's mean of by a lover or any.

03:24.360 --> 03:24.990
Probably.

03:25.260 --> 03:30.500
So we have zero because we don't have any houses have a fire yet.

03:30.690 --> 03:34.840
They This really doesn't not resemble me.

03:34.990 --> 03:38.210
I hope that have a reality Niblett inside.

03:38.220 --> 03:44.880
But the master can't detect this one this year hides ability and configuration or if any of those Haast

03:44.940 --> 03:50.010
of a problem for the configuration of the height you see the numbers I turned it down.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.790
So all those information about do different tests and the configuration of the hides.

03:54.790 --> 03:59.220
I really didn't see how much virtual machine protected by the heights.

03:59.220 --> 04:03.950
I mean you do have five if we can get here one two three four and five.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.740
You have five board on virtual machine.

04:06.990 --> 04:14.300
So you should know that to hide ability protect the on virtual machine and not disposed of even embetter

04:14.310 --> 04:22.630
your machine is part of ease out of the hide ability to only work at the limit of the power it on virtually

04:22.630 --> 04:23.360
that machine.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.010
So there we have heard the.

04:25.040 --> 04:30.090
If you remember when reconfigured headbutt you automatically detect the two externals but as we have

04:30.300 --> 04:33.550
learned one and plan to use them the head.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.440
Then we have configuration issue.

04:35.450 --> 04:41.940
If we have for example our problem right here about the configuration of the height you get the details

04:42.060 --> 04:42.700
right.

04:42.870 --> 04:49.450
They do that astore also any issues happen to them or you can see them right.

04:49.860 --> 04:57.000
So if you remember when we talk about purity that mean if something wrong happened to this host one

04:57.000 --> 05:05.370
of those hosts do restore will take some RTT how we can get the priority of the virtual machine in our

05:05.370 --> 05:06.660
cost file.

05:07.050 --> 05:14.320
So if you back to the country as the same right here when we do this fit and give it the priority Vonda

05:14.360 --> 05:15.730
VM override.

05:15.780 --> 05:21.480
Also we have the option to do VM override for hi everybody.

05:21.570 --> 05:31.920
So we click on it we click odd to add up our VM overwrite and there we chose to add new virtual machine

05:32.330 --> 05:38.880
as the same as we did then we chose one of the virtual machine that should restart first and then the

05:38.910 --> 05:40.320
second and data to it.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.850
For example for example Windows 7 and Buttrick but me we want to make an overnight and Izmit your machine.

05:46.890 --> 05:54.300
We click OK and know if you remember in the preview section about a depressed we have only this option

05:54.570 --> 05:58.000
available and only one or two option available.

05:58.140 --> 06:03.240
Now we have more options available to the Zahed.

06:03.270 --> 06:11.040
So the first one automation levade mean is one of us to Gerolstein do VM restart priority this option

06:11.040 --> 06:12.400
was not available.

06:12.430 --> 06:19.810
We were there is only when we enable done Bespin has this option become available.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.260
So you see the option that we have used cluster sitting.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.550
And we have a high medium and low.

06:26.630 --> 06:29.230
So the Aristarchi priority for me.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.180
We can charge is for example Hydes.

06:31.180 --> 06:31.850
That's me.

06:31.980 --> 06:39.060
If something ranke happened to the hot tub dispute you automatically start rebooting this virtual machine.

06:39.060 --> 06:45.100
First we give it to a high restart boogity this virtual machine.

06:45.540 --> 06:51.150
Then of course we have some other information that's hard in the region about the other options star

06:51.150 --> 06:54.310
next opportunity even when he is on top of it.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.900
And that's I mean to stick to one that's hardest thing is that he will be started after the board or

06:59.130 --> 07:06.150
or after getting to gives terabit etc. then the time between them are disconfirmation we see the do

07:06.270 --> 07:13.580
preview videos so we can't chill's any virtual machine and give it to parity to be restarted first.

07:13.590 --> 07:17.240
So next we see another of our mission about to do heyes soon in.
