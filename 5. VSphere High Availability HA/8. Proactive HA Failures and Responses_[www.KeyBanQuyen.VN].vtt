WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:10.020
Blogging so I'm not the option of these fear heights of ability is do aktiv filer and respon So of course

00:10.020 --> 00:16.230
we need to enable the provocative heights of abilities before be able to make any change.

00:16.440 --> 00:22.550
So David spear heads of ability know also detect the hard work condition of the ears.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.660
I Haas this is due to the height of BTD wrist band and Fila.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.860
So no it's work out have it on the hardware.

00:32.210 --> 00:39.620
It allows you to evacuees the virtual machine before the hardware issue cause an entourage vitrine machine

00:39.630 --> 00:47.490
with the help of proxy hides so proxy hides ability works in conjunction with hardware Bon-Bon monotone

00:47.500 --> 00:54.540
installation to receive the health you of the hardware component such as the memory the fans the power

00:54.540 --> 00:56.090
supply etc..

00:56.370 --> 01:03.580
So you can configure the for height and ability to respond according to filer of hardware components.

01:03.630 --> 01:11.250
This future proactively await the virtual machine down times by detecting the hardware files and blast

01:11.250 --> 01:15.230
that E-6 I host into cantin mode.

01:15.330 --> 01:22.650
So this future activity of the virtual machine downtimes by detecting hardware firewall and blast that

01:22.680 --> 01:30.960
E6 I host in the current mode or in the maintenance mode based on configuration option this option right.

01:31.290 --> 01:38.010
You need to have the dear S in public on the cluster to make use of proactive of course you need to

01:38.010 --> 01:41.240
have this for the rest of the.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.150
If you don't have the DNS enabled in this cluster the proxy height of ability will not be available

01:48.600 --> 01:50.570
in your cluster.

01:50.640 --> 01:57.720
So if any hardware component is firelit and it is markets as in healthy by buy hardware monitoring this

01:57.730 --> 02:06.010
spear will classify the afflicted a host as either a moderately degraded or severely degraded.

02:06.170 --> 02:10.600
Was it on the component of Filer dispirit plus that's a fixed it is x.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.570
I hauled into new states call it current in mold.

02:14.730 --> 02:21.250
So in the current mode there is when not used E6 I host derrieres will eliminate that.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.980
I have a file and put it into current mode.

02:26.160 --> 02:33.270
And I've read using it in your virtual machine plus mint and also is will attempt to invoke the host

02:33.360 --> 02:37.150
as long as it will not cause performance issues.

02:37.170 --> 02:44.860
You can also configure proxy of heights to place to degraded E6 I was into maintenance mode.

02:45.060 --> 02:51.900
We performed a valuation of virtual machine to other healthy Isak's I housed in the cluster so proxy

02:52.150 --> 02:55.320
hides we can respond to a different type of Filer.

02:55.350 --> 03:00.470
Currently there are five fire event that are supported.

03:00.630 --> 03:08.570
We have the power supply the memory the fund the storage and the network if the proxy of height ability

03:08.570 --> 03:15.390
to detect any is true in those five hardware the power supply or the money to fund Tostado network it

03:15.540 --> 03:17.190
will take action.

03:17.310 --> 03:21.100
This has ease in a filer situation.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.420
So how to configure the proxy hides.

03:25.560 --> 03:32.640
Of course after enabling the proxy hides from this place highlighted we're back to proactive hides and

03:32.640 --> 03:35.010
we have the option to chose automation.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.880
LEVIN We have manually and automated.

03:38.280 --> 03:44.910
So if we click on the device it's very simple manually recentre set of rules to just migration accommodation

03:44.990 --> 03:46.140
on your machine.

03:46.230 --> 03:51.000
When he did text up filer at the level of the hardware that's me.

03:51.090 --> 03:56.980
The hostilely work bots have a finer detection of the hardware that's mean up performance deterioration

03:56.990 --> 03:58.110
in the hardware.

03:58.110 --> 04:04.020
We have some performance determination as to look at the hardware but the holes still work without any

04:04.020 --> 04:04.860
problem.

04:04.890 --> 04:11.760
So when we chose manually the proxy of hide well do just migration for the virtual machine.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.400
It will give you on that occasion to do the migration.

04:14.670 --> 04:18.570
Then we have automated that's me but let's do a proxy fight.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.840
IBT to work alone automatically.

04:20.880 --> 04:29.000
So the video machine will be migrated to a whole host and degraded host will be intruded into content

04:29.250 --> 04:34.530
or mental and more dependent on the configuration proxy of hides the automation levade.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.980
It's about a little bit of a file.

04:38.580 --> 04:50.560
So we have the remediation that's mean that shows actually might take when he gets an order or our performance

04:50.600 --> 04:52.110
duration in the hardware.

04:52.420 --> 04:58.140
So we have three option the current mode mix mode and the maintenance mode.

04:58.330 --> 05:05.180
So the first one the current and mode for our fighter this option balance performance and availability

05:05.410 --> 05:09.010
but we didn't do use out of Persily degraded host.

05:09.040 --> 05:15.820
As long as virtual machine performance is in effect in simple they're not in your virtual machine edition

05:15.880 --> 05:18.680
on the passio degraded Haast.

05:18.790 --> 05:28.000
So we only have our Marcial degraded host so we have a situation Marcial degree Ditto's and cival degraded

05:28.010 --> 05:28.590
Haast.

05:28.650 --> 05:31.650
What is it severely filed Haast.

05:31.900 --> 05:40.100
So in our partially degraded host the height of ability will put this horse in the current mode.

05:40.270 --> 05:46.960
That's me here when Rockwell is trying to the desk to not migrate any virtual machine to this host.

05:47.260 --> 05:53.050
That's me dislodges will be in the current Lamott not virtual machine will be added or migrated to this

05:53.140 --> 05:53.550
house.

05:53.570 --> 05:58.610
That's have the problem that of the Marcial degraded host.

05:58.750 --> 06:04.530
So it will keep it through the machine performance enough except that it would keep it to or your machine

06:04.600 --> 06:05.890
work in that house.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.060
That's have a problem but not Nuvigil much would be migrated to this first.

06:11.170 --> 06:17.790
Then we have the current mode for moderate and maintenance mode for severe filer that Skype didn't mix

06:17.800 --> 06:21.570
it MMOG mixes between current and maintenance mode.

06:22.120 --> 06:29.350
So it will keep the virtual machine running on the host for a moderated file but it will the video machine

06:29.350 --> 06:31.370
for severe filers.

06:31.570 --> 06:37.810
This option balance performance and availability but we didn't do users of moderately degraded holes

06:37.930 --> 06:41.620
as long as virtual machine performance is you know exceed this.

06:41.620 --> 06:49.960
Ensure that your machine does not run on severely filer Haast the situation will balance between the

06:49.960 --> 06:52.030
performance and of ability.

06:52.200 --> 06:58.990
It will give you the best performance in your environment in due cluster and also we'll try to give

06:58.990 --> 07:03.090
you the most ability that you can have in this vigin machine.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.730
So we is moderated.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.800
Degraded host.

07:06.850 --> 07:15.370
As long as virtual machine performance is fixed Did that mean if the performance of the cluster is infected

07:15.370 --> 07:18.660
they will migrate to those virtual machine to another host.

07:18.700 --> 07:26.060
But if he felt that win him it creates a virtual machine that has the top of the problem to another

07:26.060 --> 07:29.190
host it will have a problem in the performance.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.720
So it will take the decision to leave.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.700
Does your machine work and running.

07:34.790 --> 07:43.850
That's a moderated degraded host but in a situation when you find that the hosts have a severely Fylde

07:43.910 --> 07:50.570
problem here in McGlade are the virtual machine inside that host and use it in another host.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.140
That's me.

07:51.200 --> 07:57.840
Hey we'll give you the ability but the performance will be down in this situation even if there are

07:57.940 --> 08:05.330
are overloading in other hosts they will migrate to the spiritual machine to other holes in a situation

08:05.330 --> 08:07.740
we have a severely fide host.

08:07.760 --> 08:14.300
So you will have the availability of a virtual machine but the performance will be a little lower than

08:14.630 --> 08:15.650
the first one.

08:15.650 --> 08:22.970
This one concentrates on the performance lets me give the vitriol machine inside file it hosts.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.370
But in this situation it will migrate to the video machine to give you the ability.

08:28.820 --> 08:34.970
Then we have the option to maintenance mode for Filer's will migrate all the virtual machine from the

08:34.970 --> 08:36.450
host and place.

08:36.500 --> 08:43.490
E6 I host in maintenance mode this option will ensure virtual machine do not run on partially sighted

08:43.490 --> 08:44.150
Haast.

08:44.300 --> 08:52.140
In this situation even we have a partially sighted host that mean small problem in the host when McGees

08:52.200 --> 08:58.610
on the virtual machine to other host no matter the situation of the hostile Carcetti or severely it

08:58.660 --> 09:01.200
will degrade the virtual machine to the other host.

09:01.370 --> 09:04.070
And we put this horse in the maintenance mode.

09:04.340 --> 09:09.800
You know do a this model when you put a horse in a moment in this mode this pulse is out of service

09:10.190 --> 09:16.460
and gets an interrogation to the administrator that this host is in the maintenance mode to make the

09:16.910 --> 09:19.660
solution or the fixation to this house.

09:19.670 --> 09:23.680
So this is the option that we have simply the current mode.

09:23.870 --> 09:27.680
Meant not new virtual machine additions on the host.

09:27.780 --> 09:32.560
It will keep only division machines that exist inside this without adding any new virtual machine.

09:32.570 --> 09:38.960
So the DNS will eliminate this horse for the balance when he makes its own calculation for the balance

09:38.960 --> 09:39.830
of the cluster.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.780
It would eliminate this horse from the calculation.

09:42.880 --> 09:50.480
They it most give virtual machine running on the horse for moderated filer but it will migrate virtual

09:50.480 --> 09:55.530
machine for server file and then we have the maintenance mode.

09:55.750 --> 10:03.070
This will McGinty's all the virtual machine from the host and blast a host into the maintenance mob.

10:03.590 --> 10:05.620
So this is a different option that we have.

10:05.810 --> 10:10.280
We chose automatically if we want to use the proxy file or we chose this one.

10:10.310 --> 10:16.550
Then we decide which one we have if we have more hosts available we always choose Menton a small because

10:16.550 --> 10:24.200
we have a lot of holes for example that huge environments if we have our media environment we chose

10:24.200 --> 10:30.730
this one because we try to keep using the Holst's until we have a severely virus.

10:30.740 --> 10:36.920
Then we migrate the host if we have a smal environment that's mean we know that if we McGeary to the

10:36.920 --> 10:42.430
virtual machine from that house to another host we'll have an overloading in the cluster.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.370
Then when we have a problem.

10:44.390 --> 10:49.320
So for that we chose to put only the current in mode and keep our work.

10:49.430 --> 10:52.640
So it's information about the situation of your one.

10:52.960 --> 10:57.690
Then we have another option rated do proxy of heights availability provider.

10:57.950 --> 11:03.970
This is the plugin that is monitoring the health of the server.

11:04.280 --> 11:04.760
This one.

11:04.760 --> 11:12.020
You get it from the sales support that's mean if you buy our server from HP you can contact each beat

11:12.020 --> 11:13.070
to give you the plugin.

11:13.100 --> 11:19.740
Then you added to the server and you'll see a list of plugging great hair that exist in this data center.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.560
For example the first one is HP.

11:22.710 --> 11:26.160
Reversal we see a plugging of HP didn't we have another set.

11:26.190 --> 11:29.740
But then we see the plugging of then etc..

11:29.900 --> 11:36.590
So we see the difference plugging right here and the filer condition block it some action.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.900
This is Applegate's.

11:37.940 --> 11:41.950
You can get it for almost free for from two different vonder.

11:42.050 --> 11:48.350
I don't know if there are some vonder whole ask you to pay for it but I think I'll want to give this

11:48.500 --> 11:49.580
plugging for free.

11:49.790 --> 11:55.270
You added to the different cost then you enable it to track any filer.

11:55.280 --> 12:01.360
Of course the striation we're not going to work if you don't have our blocking for monitoring to healthy

12:01.490 --> 12:03.200
of the host.

12:03.260 --> 12:07.620
So this is the proxy of hides filers and the response.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.070
So next we'll discover more future.
