00:02.200 --> 00:02.830
Logging.

00:03.010 --> 00:08.060
So the next option in Visteon heights of ability is hard to beat that Astar.

00:08.530 --> 00:15.280
If I remember right there when I told you that the head to beat UC you know the text if the other horse

00:15.340 --> 00:18.090
is work but actually drove the Ethernet Network.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.330
Also we have a head to beat send this audio live it off the top of the muster stand.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.520
I heard a bit too that the start has all the virtual machine into the host work but actually when he

00:28.520 --> 00:35.290
says you know does the other host still work perfectly even he does not have a connection to the network.

00:35.470 --> 00:41.740
But I mean if we have a problem at the network management we know that's the other hosts still work

00:41.740 --> 00:44.390
perfectly troubador that data stored.

00:44.710 --> 00:52.620
So for that we always need to have at least two shared storage two external storage for the heights

00:52.650 --> 00:54.310
of ability.

00:54.340 --> 01:01.200
Imagine that we have only one that those took and disk that are stored loose connection and have a problem

01:01.210 --> 01:03.070
for example adding network cable.

01:03.070 --> 01:06.540
So I'll do the server will be out of service.

01:06.700 --> 01:14.170
And for example if one of them ticked down the other slave to get information about the master and he

01:14.290 --> 01:18.210
does not know how to make do the master set up.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.100
So we have a problem situation when we have our data center out of service.

01:22.100 --> 01:28.660
So for those we always want to use atlast to datastore to another.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.070
Or if you have no it will be good.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.930
So for that you see this ferrites of ability is that I start to monitor host and virtual machine when

01:38.110 --> 01:40.640
management network has filed.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.990
We have a problem in the network internet network connection.

01:44.140 --> 01:50.440
So he used that I started when he told the host Vicent the server select two that I store for each host

01:50.710 --> 01:55.100
using the policy and that does or preference specific below.

01:55.810 --> 02:00.190
So the first option we have is automatically selected accessible from the host.

02:00.350 --> 02:06.550
Here Will the text Aldo's that are still available in this cluster that have a connection with all the

02:06.550 --> 02:08.380
host or any of those host.

02:08.530 --> 02:16.510
So I would put it and use it to start a herd to get to know the situation of the host connected to that.

02:16.810 --> 02:23.140
So then we have these that are not only from the specific list we need to chose to host.

02:23.140 --> 02:29.770
So when you chose one of them they show you the host that can be monitoring Troke this one with bucket

02:29.770 --> 02:34.290
like that and things like that and its just this one.

02:34.430 --> 02:41.810
So when you select one of those Lanhee automatically show all the host that can be monitoring from this

02:42.320 --> 02:44.630
external that does the lot.

02:44.630 --> 02:50.980
Number two and then when we chose one he show you all the host that can be monitoring from this store.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.480
For example if you have two ears because I number four that connect only to learn one if were in check

02:56.480 --> 03:02.660
this one we see only three E6 I mean check the land number what you us to do.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.310
E6 I know but for audits.

03:04.310 --> 03:04.990
Right.

03:05.330 --> 03:09.820
So the second option is that I start only from the specific list thats me.

03:09.840 --> 03:17.010
It is only just that I start distraught I start to send her the beats and get a situation of different

03:17.120 --> 03:19.090
insects in our cluster.

03:19.340 --> 03:26.540
But in this situation we use it when we chose for example to a store and something wrong happened to

03:26.540 --> 03:31.850
one of those that are for example disconnect or then you connect it again.

03:32.010 --> 03:39.080
Even we do seem live this is not store will be out of do hurt the between that our he will not use this

03:39.080 --> 03:43.770
that our store when its back to life gets affirmation of all the different tones.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.660
So for that it is always recommended to use automatically or to use those that are stored from the specific

03:50.660 --> 03:53.700
list and complement automatically if needed.

03:54.040 --> 04:00.320
But I mean if we are for example four or five store we still do want that we want to use for head between

04:00.650 --> 04:07.270
if something happened to do that or store he automatically will chose another one and use it for getting

04:07.270 --> 04:10.490
the hard to get information from the different instincts.

04:10.550 --> 04:16.190
So it is always recommended to have to extend another dose if you have more.

04:16.190 --> 04:22.340
It will be good if you are for example take your usual chores for example five six seven or even all

04:22.340 --> 04:26.750
the same not just look but do work without any problem.

04:26.750 --> 04:31.690
It is always a comedy is automatically here with select all available.

04:31.850 --> 04:37.960
He will use two or four from them to get information we use for the pastor out of state.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.050
He automatically will chose the other available at another store to send a herald.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.930
BT So this is the idea about our head.

04:46.190 --> 04:51.110
You always chose automatically or your controls the one that you want to do that.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.820
The beating they have.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.480
Do other than that option.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.870
This one is a little odd.

04:55.880 --> 05:02.270
I said you at some Calment right head for example sent comment for our specific advice that all the

05:02.270 --> 05:08.810
hosts concerned at being too easy to see that I am a life in institution for example this Haast lose

05:08.870 --> 05:14.540
connection with the muster and other route also lost connection.

05:14.690 --> 05:20.630
To do that I thought Here we have another option to send for example of being too specific to the advice

05:20.930 --> 05:23.120
that exists in an older place.

05:23.240 --> 05:27.890
For example are you why or are so rude etc.

05:27.980 --> 05:35.590
It will sound that being to this one to say please I'm alive please tell to the muster that I'm still

05:35.680 --> 05:36.530
alive.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.280
So this one is use it for another option.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.360
You can add them right hand.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.960
So this is a different option that we have pissed off immediately.

05:45.100 --> 05:51.190
And next we'll get an example of that in Dublin do the speed of a beat see you in the next.
