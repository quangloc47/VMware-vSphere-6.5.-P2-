00:02.330 --> 00:10.520
Blogging so the performance degradation virtual machine tolerance we have 100 percent.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.900
So if we go back to this one right here and when we have a filer in this host.

00:15.920 --> 00:22.610
So the only thing we'll make great our division machine to be run an induced house in the situation

00:22.610 --> 00:25.440
when does a virtual machine make it easy to just host.

00:25.610 --> 00:32.690
We have our over loading in this host and this was in the preview all the virtual machine was consumed

00:32.750 --> 00:35.290
about 16 percent of the resource.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.770
When does one have a file and the virtual machine rebooted into the host.

00:39.770 --> 00:40.070
No.

00:40.070 --> 00:45.720
We consume about 19 or 95 percent of the resource in this house.

00:45.770 --> 00:49.350
So we have an upper body in our environment.

00:49.430 --> 00:55.190
In addition the virtual machine will be affected by overloading in the host.

00:55.260 --> 01:01.940
That's mean we individually machine work perfectly 16 percent of the Reserves the new virtual machine

01:01.940 --> 01:05.400
will cost to produce 16 percent of the resource.

01:05.540 --> 01:12.480
So the vitriol machine in this situation we are affected by have low resource.

01:12.570 --> 01:18.220
For example CPI will start freezing from time to time drame will be overloaded.

01:18.240 --> 01:22.440
The speed of the virtual machine in the room would be to slow it down.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.890
So we have the option to chose how much the machine comes through.

01:26.930 --> 01:29.680
Part of performance degradation.

01:29.870 --> 01:31.410
So we have 100 percent.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.160
That's me.

01:32.310 --> 01:39.240
The virtual machine can support us do 100 hours of overloading in the host.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.050
That's me.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.490
Even the virtual machine can be freeze it but don't care.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.470
We ask how do they.

01:45.570 --> 01:46.190
And do.

01:46.200 --> 01:52.560
I really do not care about do performance degradation in inefficient machine even division machine will

01:52.590 --> 01:57.040
be out of service for a specific time by freezing order resource.

01:57.060 --> 02:02.340
It's not a problem you see right here 100 percent is what I mean is desirable it lets me.

02:02.340 --> 02:04.920
Don't send me in education.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.600
The role of the top.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.610
Overloading or freezing.

02:08.880 --> 02:15.420
When we chose for example 15 percent that's mean when the virtual machine start getting performance

02:15.420 --> 02:16.110
degradation.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.540
About 15 percent.

02:17.670 --> 02:23.470
You should get a notification and did when we chose 0 percent raise a warning.

02:23.490 --> 02:30.550
If there is a reason file over capacity to guarantee safe performance after VM restart.

02:30.780 --> 02:39.150
Neat when we chose 0 percent when our fight over happened to this host and then the ability to restart

02:39.150 --> 02:46.770
the virtual machine into two and three if we have our performance to go in on any video machine.

02:46.770 --> 02:54.310
He will get you a message that you should shut down some virtual machine to of we do performance degradation.

02:54.480 --> 03:00.510
But when we chose 100 percent we disable this one and when we chose 15 percent that's mean it will detect

03:00.630 --> 03:06.200
about 15 percent and start getting your alert and 0 percent he will get you another.

03:06.270 --> 03:12.560
If any something wrong happened to do performance even a smart performance degradation.

03:12.570 --> 03:13.400
So next we'll see.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.890
The other option about how to beat the postal system and the next.
