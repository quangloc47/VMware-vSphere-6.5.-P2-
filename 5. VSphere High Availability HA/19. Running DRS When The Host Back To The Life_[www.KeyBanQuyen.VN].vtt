00:01.050 --> 00:10.030
Blogging so to fix the problem off the spew difference between 3 and 6 I want to.

00:10.350 --> 00:15.810
And for that I bought it of Alda's between machines that exist in Essex.

00:15.870 --> 00:20.460
I read because it is impossible to migrate about its own virtual machine.

00:20.620 --> 00:26.570
E6 I treat the tab on your SECU to another host that have a different view.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.830
So I parted of those with your machine.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.200
I agreed to game to do what I want.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.040
Then I had our room to wait.

00:34.140 --> 00:38.680
Thats when those between machine imparted on the delays will begin is deemed too easy.

00:38.700 --> 00:44.970
I numbered T because I know what it is do for a full server in my cluster.

00:45.030 --> 00:46.120
So what's the idea.

00:46.230 --> 00:48.450
Hi creates are the.

00:48.540 --> 00:57.450
This one and the VM group all the virtual machine that I want them to be migrated to is I number three.

00:57.550 --> 01:05.550
And then I add a host group of Isak's I try and give it must not run on the host in this group.

01:06.160 --> 01:12.880
If we take this group pretend the group is E6 I number three and the VM group is those virtual machine

01:13.360 --> 01:15.970
must not run in do x.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.720
I number three to wait.

01:17.740 --> 01:25.690
Every time I have a migration from it I want to E6 I drew so into a situation that's me.

01:25.870 --> 01:31.370
Does virtual machine will be separated between two hosts that have the same speed.

01:31.630 --> 01:40.630
But in the situation when I number one Boxford all live to see that the DNS will back and try to balance

01:40.750 --> 01:43.150
the resource between a different host.

01:43.270 --> 01:50.210
Because in the preview example we dont see how a division machine will back to the host thats back to

01:50.210 --> 01:50.940
the life.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.550
No were going to see a real example.

01:53.620 --> 02:02.730
So it is austerities have zero virtual machine that is I want have five virtual machine that is bolted

02:02.740 --> 02:05.070
on and protected by to hide our ability.

02:05.170 --> 02:10.740
Of course when this one is out of service does virtual machine will be migrated to do 6.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.130
I number three.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.450
And we're going to see a real example later.

02:15.460 --> 02:22.450
So no I just bought it and because I am betrothed and we'll see what will be happen later.

02:22.450 --> 02:29.420
So if we check that the virtual machine Windows XP gets into power on process and it's working.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.740
If we take this machine exists in it.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.300
I won when I took it back to life.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.900
We'll see that some of the virtual machine will be migrated to do.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.650
E6 I number two.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.290
So let's give these refresh to see if he detects the new one is expanded.

02:50.250 --> 02:54.760
It will take a little time to detect Isak's ITL back to life.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.700
Just give us a Refresh Refresh to check the study.

03:02.210 --> 03:03.010
So how does it.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.010
It's part of the life.

03:04.010 --> 03:04.580
No.

03:04.820 --> 03:10.050
And a little time you will see on the motion will happen.

03:10.130 --> 03:18.130
So is it no the dress will take action and try to make a balance of the resource between the defendant

03:18.160 --> 03:24.430
E6 I host and of course by respecting the rule of not migrating any of those virtual machines from the

03:24.440 --> 03:31.880
Isak's I want to E-6 I try to really try to separate this virtual machine B-26 I want and is excite

03:32.030 --> 03:34.390
to every trick.

03:34.460 --> 03:35.750
It's still empty.

03:35.750 --> 03:40.800
It does not have any machine yet the virtual machine still working into it.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.800
I want.

03:41.960 --> 03:48.350
The rest will make its Onka creation and will start migrating some other virtual machine through the

03:48.650 --> 03:49.070
e6.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.420
I Hulst number two.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.980
Try to make the test run

04:01.370 --> 04:10.410
monitoring the press and make it a dress to make it Uncle pronation as fast as possible.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.290
So here is the new negotiation for the Windows 7.

04:24.300 --> 04:29.580
Number three if you click on it you will see a hot migration Windows 7 from it.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.970
I want LAN to do it.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.550
I do land in Morocco.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.750
So if we wanted to excite you we'd see our new machine migrated.

04:39.960 --> 04:47.340
So it will make another calculation and we'll try to migrate another virtual machine get a height balancing.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.180
The difference is I host.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.020
Of course this task need more time.

04:53.020 --> 05:00.240
It's not happen as quickly because the center server need to take time to make its our calculation and

05:00.450 --> 05:03.270
decided the best choice to do is.

05:03.420 --> 05:10.170
And in the right environment when we have a huge E6 I horsed and vision machine that's take a lot of

05:10.170 --> 05:13.640
time to work perfectly.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.200
So this is the idea.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.840
After a moment he will balance activity and machine between those walls.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.950
I have another situation that I can't do it in dislodges.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.290
You can't do it by yourself.

05:27.580 --> 05:32.800
For example here we reconfigured to hides operability in this cluster.

05:32.890 --> 05:37.970
He automatically chose the E-6 einen Vertrag has our muster.

05:38.170 --> 05:45.700
In my situation I can't give a failure to explain them but we do see another example of how he will

05:46.180 --> 05:49.660
chose another master because I used to this understood.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.680
But inside E6 I am pretty.

05:51.720 --> 05:59.200
If this is exciting and it is out of service he will try to migrate to Vicent or server from is explained

05:59.230 --> 06:02.790
every two years because I one or two in this situation.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.050
I will be out of the central server.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.740
I can't recall descrying to see what will happen.

06:08.740 --> 06:15.570
Also this machine can't beat superlatives by eating what I want and is exciting too because this top

06:15.720 --> 06:22.930
story would have only a up at around and only E6 I number three who have 12 gigabytes of around.

06:22.930 --> 06:23.660
That's called.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.080
Do we center.

06:25.210 --> 06:29.130
So I will lose control of the central server.

06:29.200 --> 06:37.090
In my situation in your situation if the Visby ability trolls are Isak's eyeholes for example talk or

06:37.090 --> 06:45.050
one that does not have the central server try to power off that server and after a moment's check right

06:45.340 --> 06:48.140
and you will find that he chose another server.

06:48.250 --> 06:53.700
For example is X I number 2 or 6 I number 1 to be do Mustin.

06:53.890 --> 06:57.270
So this is the idea of the vespere of ability.

06:57.340 --> 07:02.290
And next we'll going to discover a moderate future of the V12 you spit.

07:02.410 --> 07:09.520
If you have any question about his ability please post it in the discussion and I will be happy to help

07:09.520 --> 07:09.960
you.

07:10.030 --> 07:17.200
Also if you have any information that you want to share with us please do it because I want to learn

07:17.200 --> 07:20.080
from you as you learn from me.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.920
See you in the next section.
