00:01.130 --> 00:02.000
Blogging.

00:02.130 --> 00:11.280
So no let's get a real example about our server have a file and see the action will be taken from this

00:11.400 --> 00:12.660
period of ability.

00:13.050 --> 00:15.380
So now we have all the vitriol machine parted on.

00:15.450 --> 00:23.480
It is protected by the ability for example Check this one is ex-spy.

00:23.610 --> 00:26.960
Number two that have Windows 7.

00:27.060 --> 00:30.880
0 1 here is it two Windows 7 0 1 work.

00:31.020 --> 00:36.990
In our modern tape and we're going to take down this I host ours.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.300
There are some files in this one and see Dupee have you of this display identity.

00:42.420 --> 00:47.930
So that's merely a virtual machine working in our environment and something wrong would happen to this

00:47.930 --> 00:52.980
server and we'll see the action will be taken from do this be it.

00:53.190 --> 01:01.650
So I will go and power off our server after is X I number two so shut down

01:04.680 --> 01:11.450
and we'll give you a little time intill to detect that there are not head between we.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.790
I hope not but.

01:12.980 --> 01:21.390
And then we'll see do action be happen to this virtual machine in that battle.

01:30.870 --> 01:33.820
So no it is out of service.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.550
As you see we have it right here.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.930
This is Excite is out of service.

01:39.140 --> 01:48.060
We checked this one the virtual machine is data it is our of is to then you see this has an ability

01:48.080 --> 01:51.090
detects a possible host a of this host.

01:51.090 --> 01:56.050
If we back to the cluster we seek information about the host.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.390
Why is it excite to this ability.

02:00.430 --> 02:04.980
Host start you do this from a height of ability fight over in progress.

02:05.170 --> 02:13.170
This is written in UCL flying over action on one virtual machine cluster in the data center miracle.

02:13.410 --> 02:19.840
So I detect that one virtual machine that's used this is because I host you see if he's bought it off

02:20.100 --> 02:22.710
it will take a little time then he will take action.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.690
It's bolted on.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.260
No.

02:24.410 --> 02:33.000
If we back right here and reload the page we see that virtual machine start put it on again without

02:33.030 --> 02:34.060
any problem.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.600
So it will take a little time.

02:36.760 --> 02:43.200
He will get on the formation the light hair and just give it the time.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.570
So you see the machine is bolted on.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.980
If we check this bit your machine will find that that exists in another host.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.270
So it is no work in India is X number three in the preview.

02:55.290 --> 02:59.470
This your machine was powered it on into is X number two.

02:59.490 --> 03:04.610
No it's become in do is X number three and everything is OK.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.870
Get off our mission.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.090
So mission accomplished successfully.

03:08.250 --> 03:14.700
But do a hostile look keep showing up if we back right there you will see.

03:14.710 --> 03:15.480
Where is it.

03:15.480 --> 03:24.750
It's bolted on like when you unplug the power for any victory machine or any physical machine so it

03:24.750 --> 03:28.860
will power on normally without any problem.

03:28.950 --> 03:33.760
So we click on these and press and turn to complete power on.

03:33.770 --> 03:41.930
So this is distraction off of this because to the house number two is out of service and they automatically

03:43.160 --> 03:44.740
reboot the video machine.

03:44.750 --> 03:51.330
That was right there and the virtual machine work without any problem after making reboot.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.880
So next we'll see when this hosts will back to life.

03:54.950 --> 03:57.210
What will happen next.
