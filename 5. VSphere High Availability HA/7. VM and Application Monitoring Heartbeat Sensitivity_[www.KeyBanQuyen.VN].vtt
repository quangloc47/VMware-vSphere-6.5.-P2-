WEBVTT

00:01.410 --> 00:10.130
Lagging so let's discover V.M. money Mancini in the preview we talk about the other option that is Abdula

00:10.130 --> 00:11.270
view of the host.

00:11.270 --> 00:17.150
If we can check this one you'll see that our the hosts monitoring is desirable.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.910
We only have do the monitoring.

00:20.210 --> 00:28.100
So this is a deliberate on the host and this want to do it off the vitriol machine so that we have option

00:28.190 --> 00:29.680
for the virtual machine.

00:29.900 --> 00:35.510
We have the first one is the LeT mean with those not active hires immediately Abdula of the victory

00:35.510 --> 00:36.290
machine.

00:36.290 --> 00:42.460
We have virtual machine monitoring only and virtual machine and application monitoring.

00:42.500 --> 00:50.600
Only if we remember we told that the not wanted to introduce virtual machine the operating system and

00:50.660 --> 00:54.110
application inside that virtual machine.

00:54.140 --> 01:02.190
So if we click on this option Itek do chickadee of course if we chose disable they automatically disable

01:02.190 --> 01:02.480
it.

01:02.490 --> 01:12.710
Alda's option so in Dublin ahead bit monitoring is the same as we do in the hosts we used to head to

01:12.710 --> 01:12.920
beat.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.230
Its like a bank the monitoring wristlets individual virtual machine.

01:17.240 --> 01:25.520
If dir VM were truly heard the bits are not received within six times application monitoring receipt.

01:25.550 --> 01:34.530
And if we do the virtual machine if in guest heard debates are not received read a time so if we check

01:34.680 --> 01:35.710
this one.

01:35.970 --> 01:41.790
And of course you need to have a VM where you're inside this vitrine machine all the virtual machine

01:41.820 --> 01:47.720
in the cluster that we're going through is in the height of your belief we should of them were true.

01:48.120 --> 01:56.370
So for that the height of ability send a bit to the different virtual machine and the VM would do it

01:56.400 --> 02:02.540
inside those virtual machine respond to that Harold beats automatically stunt hard to beat.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.550
That this virtual machine and operating system inside.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.270
This is our key.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.780
It's working perfectly.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.690
So we chose them monitoring that's mean.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.440
We monitored Do agencies think inside the different virtual machine.

02:16.590 --> 02:20.420
So turn on them where you heard the beat mean act.

02:20.430 --> 02:25.810
You've heard to bits to them where true in every of those virtual machine we we chose.

02:25.810 --> 02:26.440
OK.

02:26.760 --> 02:35.030
You can send a command to all the virtual machine in that cluster and your own VM virtual beats.

02:35.040 --> 02:43.060
So when I heard the beats are not received within a set time druggist's operating system is restarted.

02:43.110 --> 02:47.190
That's me with a specific time we're going to see it right there.

02:47.490 --> 02:53.380
When do cluster does not get a head to beat in a specific time.

02:53.460 --> 03:00.960
It will send a command to do the virtual machine to restart it will power it off then are powered on

03:01.200 --> 03:02.390
again.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.130
And of course you should take careful when you do the monitoring.

03:08.140 --> 03:15.970
For example in some situation the virtual machine freezing just isn't for a specific time in that time.

03:16.010 --> 03:18.100
Do what you'd stop.

03:18.280 --> 03:26.110
Ahead the beats and do surveys of height and with it when I see that this virtual machine is out of

03:26.110 --> 03:29.940
service because it does not get any Herbie's in that situation.

03:29.950 --> 03:37.180
We will restart the virtual machine and we have a problem of the heights of ability for two or three

03:37.180 --> 03:39.860
minutes until the virtual machine restarted.

03:39.910 --> 03:46.740
Even there still exist in that virtual machine that you phrase it in that time working perfectly.

03:46.750 --> 03:54.820
For example if you use ah backup service for example or software that backup the application inside

03:55.330 --> 04:04.360
one of your virtual machine sometimes when the backup starts on and do the backup of the data into victory

04:04.360 --> 04:08.580
or machine it is the fall super You are restless.

04:08.590 --> 04:16.440
You consume about 100 percent of CPI in that time some service individual must be freezing.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.270
He can't work for that time.

04:19.300 --> 04:25.600
When do backup service use the fall Sippy resouce one of them is the VM word.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.160
You'll drop the backup of the individual machine.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.240
Where all freezing.

04:31.450 --> 04:35.780
And then when the height of ability there is not good.

04:35.830 --> 04:41.260
I heard the bit of being worked through here we'll try to restart the operation system.

04:41.320 --> 04:49.990
So if you restart the operation system or division machine that's start working the backup start doing

04:50.050 --> 04:50.940
a backup.

04:51.100 --> 04:58.810
You will lost your backup and you will lost the data drove the backup process and maybe the operating

04:58.810 --> 05:00.520
system would be damaged.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.330
Drag the backup process.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.610
So we should be careful when we use the virtual machine monitoring.

05:06.760 --> 05:13.690
So always recommended to disable the virtual machine monitoring in an environment until you are sure

05:13.690 --> 05:19.190
that this virtual machine can be monitoring by height.

05:19.230 --> 05:24.210
Operability didn't we have the application as the same as the dream machine.

05:24.430 --> 05:33.640
We used to have the beat odds delivery of the application for example database the exchange the Oracle

05:34.030 --> 05:42.970
the antivirals etc. application exists into your machine octave them and make them to send a heartbeat

05:43.090 --> 05:47.280
to do cluster and when ahead we are not receiving.

05:47.350 --> 05:50.380
We didn't ask Did time do guests.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.470
Operating system is restarted.

05:52.480 --> 05:58.660
So the same again as I told you if the application have a problem and freeze it for a specific time

05:59.080 --> 06:05.780
the heartbeat will be lost did they end up had a reboot will reboot or restart the virtual machine.

06:06.010 --> 06:08.380
So always we use them.

06:08.530 --> 06:15.260
But if you are shrewd you can use one of them or both of them.

06:15.460 --> 06:23.780
Then we do the heartbeat monitoring sensitivity sensitivity of the head bit monitoring.

06:23.830 --> 06:32.950
We have the default option do allow the medium and height so do whites and do allow lets me do some

06:32.990 --> 06:33.800
CBT.

06:33.970 --> 06:40.960
We tend to get ahead to be seat time if you remember right here we have a sick time before a star is

06:40.960 --> 06:43.280
starting to operate consistent.

06:43.300 --> 06:50.020
So if we chose low you see we shall I take of course we have costume to a costume number and we have

06:50.020 --> 06:54.420
the default one right here as you see right here.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.810
So this child's height and see do that right.

06:59.650 --> 07:07.020
So when we chose a higher sensitivity we get about 13 seconds for the final interval.

07:07.390 --> 07:08.160
That's me.

07:08.320 --> 07:16.610
The height of the service will wait about 13 seconds before I start restarting the operating system.

07:16.810 --> 07:25.350
When the height of ability is not to get anywhere the beats just get your machine for a 30 second.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.890
He will send a command to restart the machine.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.830
Of course we chose low.

07:30.850 --> 07:35.500
He will wait about two minutes before restarting the virtual machine.

07:37.240 --> 07:46.140
Didn't have the minimum up time that's mean he will surely get a minimum of two minutes.

07:46.210 --> 07:54.190
I mean when we power a virtual machine after Poland is between Mushin he will start sending our herd

07:54.190 --> 07:59.900
to beat the herd to beat schul to beat the rest of it for about two minutes.

08:00.010 --> 08:07.070
He should get a hold of B's for two minutes before start counting Fidler and Durbach.

08:07.210 --> 08:11.660
So if he gets hurt for only one minute then he's lost the head.

08:11.810 --> 08:12.820
It will wait.

08:12.830 --> 08:18.360
We're not going to restart the virtual machine because I know that this machine is in the power and

08:18.380 --> 08:23.240
on proces when your power of your machine he would take a time to power on.

08:23.360 --> 08:32.800
Then when everything is part of this virtual machine start sending a heartbeat for two minutes or three.

08:32.810 --> 08:41.240
And then when he gets his bit for two minutes then he will keep tracking or monitoring division.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.810
When he does not get a hold of it for him.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.550
He will try to restart this machine machine.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.770
But if we leave the configuration like that he would every time restart your machine.

08:53.770 --> 08:58.330
This pretty much will keep restarting restarting for Element time.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.850
For that we have maximum bar VM reset.

09:01.990 --> 09:08.700
How much it will restart the virtual machine if he does not get the head to beat when we choose height

09:08.860 --> 09:11.380
he took three times.

09:11.530 --> 09:12.000
That's me.

09:12.040 --> 09:18.400
When he does not get anywhere to beat for 30 seconds he will start the vitrine machine.

09:18.510 --> 09:26.470
Then after a little time he gets a bit thin he lost it then he will try to restart the vision machine

09:26.470 --> 09:34.420
for the second time then for the third time after three try of restarting the machine will stop restarting

09:34.420 --> 09:37.530
this virtual machine and forgets about it.

09:37.570 --> 09:40.070
Then we have maximal wristy time windows.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.560
We have one now which also had one out or two or three etc..

09:44.710 --> 09:54.100
That's mean he will make do to restart then he should Dwights about one now before sending another restart.

09:54.130 --> 09:57.000
So how do you control as much as you want.

09:57.010 --> 10:02.690
Of course you can it it does one for example you give it about 10 minutes.

10:02.690 --> 10:07.560
That's mean he should wait about 10 minutes before restarting to visit your machine.

10:07.630 --> 10:12.770
And of course when we chose right here dillo change it for a minute.

10:12.790 --> 10:15.480
This one for five minutes.

10:15.490 --> 10:22.990
This one tree and this one about seven or eight die before you make the next restart.

10:23.020 --> 10:26.800
So this is the option all for do the V.M. monitory.

10:27.040 --> 10:34.900
And as always we try to avoid using this one because it's give you a lot of problem in your environment

10:35.310 --> 10:37.800
and you are very shrewd about it.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.270
Then you can use C++.
