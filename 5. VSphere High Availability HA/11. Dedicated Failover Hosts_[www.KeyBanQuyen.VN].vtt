00:00.350 --> 00:06.970
Do we have the option that college dedicated fight over just this one is a cool option.

00:07.170 --> 00:12.920
You reserve one or as much host for dedicated server.

00:12.930 --> 00:16.460
If we click my tent which was for example to host one of those.

00:16.590 --> 00:20.360
Of course you can chose all the host to be dedicated.

00:20.390 --> 00:22.900
That's me and your daughter that is out of service.

00:22.950 --> 00:24.300
Your shows do.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.170
Available has to make them for dedicated.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.210
Hi everybody.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.120
So what does me in this situation where do we choose for example.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.250
I want a dedicated fight over let's meet in our environment.

00:37.350 --> 00:46.560
We're going to work with this one and this one and we have our host is free from any virtual machine.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.600
It's in the standby mode.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.260
That's me.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.420
No one is this host.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.260
It will keep free of do you in.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.010
We have a problem that's needed in our situation right.

00:59.070 --> 01:06.120
We've put this house into standby and we use this to our hosts in our environment if inappropriate happen

01:06.120 --> 01:07.180
to this host.

01:07.330 --> 01:11.950
Negrete How does this must of course Wall Street migrate and reboot them.

01:11.970 --> 01:17.400
Because this one is out of service when we talk about the height or ability we talk about.

01:17.400 --> 01:24.240
Do the rebooting reboot the vision machine inside this house because the source is dead then the virtual

01:24.240 --> 01:25.410
machine will be voted off.

01:25.410 --> 01:28.380
They will try to power on them in this host.

01:28.440 --> 01:34.710
So when we have this one have a file over then all the virtual machine exists indisposed we departed

01:34.890 --> 01:35.930
in this house.

01:36.060 --> 01:42.340
Then when this host back to life ultimately we'll make great victory in Washington D.C. one.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.520
So the situation is not too high.

01:44.540 --> 01:51.120
Everybody would use the commission because we have this House voted on and this house also voted on

01:51.150 --> 01:58.880
so it will veto motion and they will back and run to this host smoothly without any problem.

01:59.130 --> 02:05.280
Then if this horse fight over and out of service it will not be boots on the vitriol in this host for

02:05.310 --> 02:07.810
this horse was understandable.

02:08.040 --> 02:15.210
Did he make it this horse back to life and use the vitriol machine into the administration or fix the

02:15.240 --> 02:17.200
fight over in this host.

02:17.220 --> 02:25.530
So this is the minute of the decades fight over Haast in the big company the chose about 10 20 Haast

02:25.530 --> 02:33.250
for dedicated to ALLERT fired or into the situation or the file over of the host.
