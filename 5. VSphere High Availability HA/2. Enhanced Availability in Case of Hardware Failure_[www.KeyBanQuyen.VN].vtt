00:01.970 --> 00:02.710
Clogging.

00:02.970 --> 00:09.190
So let's get more idea about do heights of ability and how it's worth.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.130
So for example we have three.

00:12.300 --> 00:20.480
He asks I host or treat physical survey and age of the server have some virtual machine of course.

00:20.580 --> 00:28.320
Aldo's the Verd should be in the same cluster that have configured for use in the height of ability

00:28.770 --> 00:32.040
and in a situation that we have a file server.

00:32.130 --> 00:35.100
This route have filed the problem.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.100
Take it down or any situation but that's me.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.990
This server out of service.

00:40.080 --> 00:47.220
So the highest of ability will take out a virtual machine that is a resource.

00:47.250 --> 00:56.950
So we should consider that this machine is only the resource pool of the server and not to the start.

00:57.270 --> 01:04.410
That's why I do that our upcoming future need to have our share that was and all the machine that we're

01:04.410 --> 01:12.540
going to use in our future is to be started in our shedded store and not in the local stores of the

01:12.560 --> 01:17.940
host and any virtual machine that's used to look old at the start of the server.

01:18.880 --> 01:26.810
We'll be out of service and will not be included in the Near East or in the heights of ability or in

01:26.810 --> 01:28.830
the photo et cetera.

01:29.380 --> 01:36.850
So one of the requirements is that all the virtual machine in this host should be stored in our shared

01:36.850 --> 01:39.480
storage and only use the resource pool.

01:39.480 --> 01:47.200
That's main city and the memory of this server dispute the memory the network adapter the graphic got

01:47.200 --> 01:55.980
etc. but at the AS should be use it on shared struggle between the different and toss so when this sort

01:55.980 --> 02:06.860
of take down or have a IT server on the virtual machine that is only resource for will be migrated or

02:06.870 --> 02:12.780
the exact word is not migrated because it does not have the ventilation head will be moving to another

02:12.780 --> 02:18.870
host and start using a resource pool of the other hosts available in the cluster.

02:19.200 --> 02:19.770
That's me.

02:19.840 --> 02:28.550
It's movie that indicates that Dyster is file then division machine will be part of the building when

02:28.580 --> 02:36.540
the reboot this machine inside a mother host It's like do the motion but not the motion to view motion

02:36.920 --> 02:42.780
immoral or McGinty's the virtual machine that is bolted on and keep working without any problem inside

02:42.850 --> 02:44.010
another host.

02:44.170 --> 02:49.870
But I ability it's like he first tapped a virtual machine is they then.

02:49.880 --> 02:55.010
Hey Mick it's back to the life by rebooting it inside a modem.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.720
This is the idea of heights.

02:58.010 --> 03:06.280
In this situation we have about time and do problem of the big component is the downtime we should of

03:06.310 --> 03:11.560
avoid as much as possible of a downtime for any of their surveys.

03:11.820 --> 03:18.990
Even at 3 minutes of rebooting division machine it's a problem in this big company there are the service

03:19.080 --> 03:23.110
that give you about 0 percent of the downtime.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.850
It's called default totals.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.180
So the question is why we don't default.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.930
Instead of the heights everybody will go in to see it later and defaulted on.

03:32.940 --> 03:38.450
It's not an easy tool that everyone can do it in his company.

03:38.490 --> 03:46.950
So the height of ability is easy to implement in any environment and there is not have a lot of requirement

03:47.010 --> 03:48.150
to do it.

03:48.490 --> 03:56.070
So this is the idea of the height of it take the virtual machine from this host and make it back to

03:56.070 --> 03:58.320
the live in a modern house.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.370
The difference I believe in in the cluster.

04:00.570 --> 04:02.370
So this is another diagram.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.010
This is the route of course you see that we use the same shit it's Torahs are the Starbird should have

04:08.070 --> 04:09.440
the same status.

04:09.750 --> 04:16.350
When something wrong happened to this sort right writing the virtual machine will be date and it will

04:16.350 --> 04:19.920
be rebooted in another server like that.

04:20.130 --> 04:26.670
Of course there are some rule to reboot the division machine and not host the host should have more

04:26.750 --> 04:29.580
data source that can support the new virtual machine.

04:29.580 --> 04:36.040
For example if this sort of a console port on the virtual machine this one can start to match your machine.

04:36.150 --> 04:40.060
So this virtual machine will be rebooted.

04:40.210 --> 04:46.030
One of them will be a reboot in this host and the other two that your machine will be rebooted in the

04:46.300 --> 04:47.500
second host.

04:47.710 --> 04:52.510
So the cluster will make its own computation and do it automatically.

04:52.720 --> 04:59.560
And this is very helpful when you are as a manager of the environment are out of service or at midnight

04:59.890 --> 05:05.560
and something wrong happened to your physical server all the virtual machine will be bridged in another

05:05.650 --> 05:10.890
physical server and the company will keep working without any problem.
