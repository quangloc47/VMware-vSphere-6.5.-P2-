WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.820
So we don't have any height of ability in your situation.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.820
So for that we have to at the Mission Control this option.

00:08.940 --> 00:15.280
You to have a free resource for the perfect situation that you want to use for these.

00:15.660 --> 00:18.060
So how do admission control.

00:18.300 --> 00:23.240
So the first option that we have right here is has filer cluster photographs.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.420
That's me.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.820
How much host you want.

00:27.820 --> 00:33.970
This cluster suport its own failure because of our situation right here.

00:33.970 --> 00:40.920
We have tree root so we automatically chose that this cluster can support only one file.

00:41.230 --> 00:46.170
Also it can support up to two files if we chose right there.

00:48.260 --> 00:53.090
If we chose that I said how much HAUST Fila in this one we can't chose to.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.360
But if we try to chose three it does not work it's only give us one or two.

00:58.410 --> 00:59.780
Haast why and why.

01:00.200 --> 01:07.480
If we chose three has to be firelit in this situation but to me the first one to sit and one to try

01:07.490 --> 01:10.900
to work out of it if it does not have any Holst's yet.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.480
So that's me your company is out of service.

01:13.490 --> 01:20.760
Your company is date your network and your environment is out of service totally.

01:20.870 --> 01:26.950
So it is impossible to uproots that this cluster can't support three hosts file.

01:27.080 --> 01:33.030
So you see right here Macsyma is one less than number of the host in the cluster in our cluster we have

01:33.080 --> 01:33.910
three hosts.

01:33.920 --> 01:38.740
So the maximum number will be two if we have five the maximum number will be four.

01:38.750 --> 01:45.830
If we try to tap three or four it will not going to work it's only support one or two because we have

01:45.920 --> 01:47.430
three is because I Haast.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.180
So that's what's meaning.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.720
So if we chose one that's me.

01:51.830 --> 01:57.000
This cluster we support one house filer in our situation.

01:57.010 --> 02:05.840
I mean the cluster will be able to get you to heights if only one server to get down in this situation

02:06.440 --> 02:13.730
that this one will consume 16 percent this one will consume 60 percent and this one when 16 percent

02:14.000 --> 02:20.920
use it right here and this one out of service this extent will be separated to other costs.

02:21.170 --> 02:29.870
But when we chose to host we chose that this cluster should support up to two costs filer.

02:30.050 --> 02:30.770
That's me.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.340
It will be ready if this one.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.960
I have a fighter and this one have the filer who will be able to run all the virtual machine in this

02:38.960 --> 02:39.400
world.

02:39.560 --> 02:47.040
So in this situation it will make the free space in different TOSed more than 14 percent.

02:47.080 --> 02:54.510
It will change it through 66 percent of three resource he will consume only 33 percent support discussed

02:54.890 --> 02:59.780
and on 33 percent for this host and the same for the stars.

02:59.810 --> 03:04.140
Where do we see that he will consume only thirty three percent.

03:04.140 --> 03:11.510
But that's me it will be able to power the virtual machine up to 2 percent of the resources of this

03:11.510 --> 03:12.440
house.

03:12.980 --> 03:19.700
So for example if this house had one hundred gigabytes of room you can create virtual machine as much

03:19.730 --> 03:26.410
as you want but you can't power a virtual machine more than thirty three gigabytes of time.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.870
When you power the virtual machine one to three and two total of the board on virtual machine the costume

03:32.960 --> 03:40.230
about two or three gigabyte of run you can't power any new virtual machine inside this house.

03:40.380 --> 03:45.860
I've built it will stop you to power any new virtual machine.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.390
So this is the idea about you at mission control.

03:50.390 --> 03:55.300
So in this situation you have 13 percent of the resource use it.

03:55.310 --> 04:01.880
And we have about 66 of free resource right here in the situation with this one and this one out of

04:01.880 --> 04:07.760
service here will take it to 33 percent from this virtual machine that's bolted on in this host and

04:07.810 --> 04:09.140
run it in this house.

04:09.140 --> 04:16.690
So no we have 5:54 the resource use it and we have only thirty three three resource then who will take

04:16.790 --> 04:21.980
the thirty three resource use it in this host and run them inside this home.

04:21.980 --> 04:29.130
So we have 100 percent of the resource use it and all the virtual machine is bolted on and work perfectly

04:29.140 --> 04:33.830
so we have the highest availability for our virtual machine inside this host.

04:33.830 --> 04:41.210
So that's why I tell you if we want is the height of ability we need do free resource.

04:41.330 --> 04:48.830
So when we chose one of course in our situation and a small data center we always chose list number

04:48.830 --> 04:52.780
of phyla because our cancer support lot of Filer.

04:52.940 --> 05:03.520
But in the huge environments we can make 10 20 or maybe 100 Haast can't be supported in defiler.

05:03.680 --> 05:09.970
And of course the cluster automatically calculate and give each host to free a resource that he should

05:10.130 --> 05:14.810
lift reserving for the hosts file.

05:14.870 --> 05:21.020
So when we chose for example one of the signatures one button when we chose to and click OK this condition

05:21.020 --> 05:29.230
would be changed but no it's Livy's was one they defined the hosts file overcapacity by do cluster issuer's

05:29.300 --> 05:30.340
percentage.

05:30.590 --> 05:31.190
That's me.

05:31.370 --> 05:38.560
It will define the host by that capacity if you remember the capacity reserved for the different toasts.

05:38.570 --> 05:43.480
So here we detect that we have three Haast are the three hosts of the same resource.

05:43.490 --> 05:49.670
So I will make the calculation by one of three one 3 1 of 3 of the 3 resource.

05:49.670 --> 05:50.700
When we chose 1.

05:50.720 --> 05:58.130
Then when we chose to host finder it will take 2 of 3 for wrestlers 2 of three suits and two of three

05:58.510 --> 05:59.290
it is true.

05:59.540 --> 06:05.180
But of course when you have a powerful server for example does one have to 100 gigabytes of Vermont

06:05.210 --> 06:10.880
and the other one have 100 100 so the conclusion will be changed with the percentage of the array.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.010
And the puzzle part of the C-p etc..

06:14.750 --> 06:18.340
So when we chose the cluster they automatically make it Uncle collation.

06:18.530 --> 06:25.670
Of course we can override the calculation so automatically we'll reserve 33 percent of the spew for

06:25.760 --> 06:28.760
every host because this is x.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.920
I have the same Sibiu speed.

06:31.970 --> 06:33.860
So automatically the congressional will.

06:33.950 --> 06:42.590
Thirty three percent will be free in the host one to host to and the hot streak and the memory we have

06:42.890 --> 06:47.320
84 percent because the host number three that halved is x.

06:47.330 --> 06:50.930
I host of about 11 gigabyte overclaim.

06:50.990 --> 06:55.970
So the calculation was not equal as Thirty four percent.

06:55.970 --> 06:59.720
So it is 84 percent.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.940
Of course we can override this one.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.120
For example we want to reserve 50 percent of the CPI.

07:05.390 --> 07:11.330
And for example only 64 percent of the memory so you can customize this one.

07:11.330 --> 07:17.000
Of course you need to make your own calculation to these to do a number that will work particularly

07:17.000 --> 07:18.680
in your environments.

07:18.710 --> 07:24.980
So then we have another option of course the first one is does that mean you want to disable any capacity

07:24.980 --> 07:26.210
to service for this one.

07:26.660 --> 07:33.230
When you enable this one cluster resource when any administrators in your environment.

07:33.230 --> 07:38.160
Of course you are the master administrator of the environment and you have some administrator that carries

07:38.190 --> 07:43.220
with your machine he can create as much as he want a virtual machine.

07:43.400 --> 07:50.480
But this option right here we limit departed on we know the history to create a virtual machine inside

07:50.480 --> 07:57.170
that house that consume 66 percent of the research and try to put it on he will get an alert message

07:57.170 --> 08:03.880
that you dont have the ability to power on this virtual machine because you dont have any resource to

08:03.890 --> 08:11.580
power this machine because the 33 percent is reserved for the height of ability.

08:12.350 --> 08:19.400
So how do you control disable thats mean anyone can power any virtual machine until you consume 100

08:19.400 --> 08:21.550
percent of the resource of a host.

08:21.590 --> 08:27.650
But of course if you want to get the benefits of admission control you need to enable it to trolls cluster

08:27.710 --> 08:28.190
resource.
