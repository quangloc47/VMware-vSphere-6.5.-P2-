WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:01.420
Again.

00:01.480 --> 00:08.290
So one of the question that comes to you meant ease in the situation that we use the center server as

00:08.380 --> 00:17.790
a virtual machine in a host and we manage the toaster Traub the center server.

00:18.110 --> 00:25.990
What's happened if that host is out of service how to censor server we know that the horrors that have

00:26.010 --> 00:28.470
to be Center service is out of service.

00:28.720 --> 00:38.620
And what's happened for the DNS and head of ability how will the environment take action to reboot to

00:38.620 --> 00:43.170
do vitriol machine of the reasons are sort of an inside another Haast.

00:43.210 --> 00:51.280
So for that you should know that when we use the central server as a virtual machine in our homes or

00:51.310 --> 00:58.890
even in our separate host that is not managed by the sentence server itself.

00:59.470 --> 01:05.890
That's when we create an environment and we make the configuration of the has the ability to visit on

01:05.910 --> 01:06.550
a server.

01:06.700 --> 01:16.730
We pick our hosts as our muster and other Haast in the cluster as a slave as you know we need always

01:17.180 --> 01:23.050
always we need our cluster and put this different server inside that cluster that we want to configure

01:23.100 --> 01:25.580
it for the height of ability.

01:25.670 --> 01:34.280
So when we put our height of ability configuration to be sent to a server center server will pick up

01:34.520 --> 01:38.370
our host and give it to the portal as a master.

01:38.510 --> 01:40.100
They differ on toast.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.580
We'll use it as a slave.

01:43.310 --> 01:49.090
So integration for example this Haast have to be central server.

01:49.290 --> 01:57.030
Then the Vicent of server will give the power to this host to be the master of this environment or this

01:57.030 --> 02:00.500
cluster to manage the height of a.

02:00.540 --> 02:08.610
So he tells to this host Hey you are the master and responsible for the height of ability to do this

02:08.610 --> 02:09.210
task.

02:09.210 --> 02:15.920
So we gave it to us struction to this horse to run the task for the different height of ability route.

02:15.930 --> 02:24.270
So if something wrong happened to this host the muster will take action and put out a virtual machine

02:24.330 --> 02:26.130
that's run it in this host.

02:26.190 --> 02:31.410
One of them is the view sensor inside this host or this host or any other of a liberal host.

02:31.410 --> 02:38.840
But another question that's come to your mind what's happened this must date the muster that have Hovda

02:39.420 --> 02:48.740
veteran machine or even this master who have the center server the saying that this muster how powerful

02:48.810 --> 02:58.050
to manage the host when this muster is out of service all the slave have an instruction to make a vote

02:58.140 --> 03:02.700
or to make an election to chose another Mustang.

03:02.850 --> 03:09.240
So if this muster is this live and does live where to make a decision to chose one of them to be a master

03:09.280 --> 03:10.660
this one will be our master.

03:10.670 --> 03:18.530
Or for example this one will be a muster and then when this one become a must take action that they

03:18.590 --> 03:22.330
must or shall do then who will migrate or move.

03:22.350 --> 03:28.240
All the vitriol that exists in this one and running it in another sort of.

03:28.350 --> 03:35.200
So this is the idea how the muster and slave work even the Vicent that is out of service the center

03:35.240 --> 03:40.400
server have only the option to add or delete.

03:40.450 --> 03:42.340
Also some rule.

03:42.450 --> 03:49.680
But when we can feel the heights of ability and the terrorists do this sort of serve those not do any

03:49.680 --> 03:52.250
task only give us direction to those.

03:52.270 --> 03:57.530
So rude and do still work along with the rules that did it from the center.

03:57.780 --> 04:02.640
But when the Vicent instead of is out of service we can't create any tank.

04:02.640 --> 04:07.630
We can't change a tank we can't delete or of any tank or charge in a room.

04:07.710 --> 04:15.690
All right we'll keep working we do rules that we give it before we sense instead of out of service.

04:15.690 --> 04:19.230
So this is how the different server works.

04:19.230 --> 04:22.560
Even the Vicenzo server is out of service.

04:22.790 --> 04:30.150
And so the idea that you should know is how these hosts have communication between them as we know this

04:30.220 --> 04:35.490
Hatchell be connected through August which we have an internet connection between them and this is one

04:35.490 --> 04:42.390
of the rules we have our network and the same hosts connected to created Stosh.

04:42.460 --> 04:50.710
So when the defendant tossed about it on and work with the root of the height of ability.

04:50.780 --> 04:58.370
How denote that this host is out of service how the muster know that he should power on or rebooted

04:58.380 --> 05:00.360
the vitriol machine in this posting.

05:00.370 --> 05:02.600
I'm not a horse for that.

05:02.890 --> 05:07.450
Every sort of sent on a heartbeat different server.

05:07.530 --> 05:08.190
I heard it.

05:08.200 --> 05:15.010
It's like a ping if you know we don't we want to check on and the house is worth but be we send link

05:15.130 --> 05:16.100
to that post.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.760
So the Post will respond.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.010
That's OK.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.040
Then we know that host is work perfectly.

05:22.150 --> 05:27.530
So the muster sent are hard to beat drubbed attorney and it's work.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.450
Then send it to display.

05:29.550 --> 05:30.060
Hello.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.660
Are you still alive.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.420
The slaves.

05:32.500 --> 05:32.850
Yes.

05:32.860 --> 05:33.610
I'm alive.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.530
Then sent another hello to the other slave.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.030
Hey.

05:37.050 --> 05:37.680
Hello slave.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.360
Are you alive and slave.

05:40.450 --> 05:40.860
Answer.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.610
Yes I'm alive.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.250
That's it.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.620
Then the slaves sent are you.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.750
Laved muster the muster.

05:47.770 --> 05:49.010
Yes I'm alive.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.170
That's it.

05:50.190 --> 06:00.610
So the communication between them and the server work and particularly so in a case this horse is out

06:00.610 --> 06:01.870
of service.

06:01.930 --> 06:02.870
Mr. STERN.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.660
Hello.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.620
I heard Bates dropping the display.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.650
Are you all right.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.720
Do Slade those not get any answer.

06:10.780 --> 06:16.580
Then give it another chance for two or three times they have some specific time to do it.

06:16.690 --> 06:22.330
Then when he takes that this slave is out of service he will automatically take action and that it would

06:22.360 --> 06:27.010
all the virtual machine inside of the slave or in the master itself.

06:28.240 --> 06:33.520
But in some cases we for example we have a file in the network.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.620
This cable is cut it down.

06:35.920 --> 06:41.710
They started text also that does not answer a lot of time.

06:41.740 --> 06:48.310
For example if you remember when we config our lab we create two physical network adapter for the virtual

06:48.310 --> 06:54.540
machine and two physical to work other for the management the management of the server and the most

06:54.730 --> 06:57.750
when its current a pain to do management.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.030
Hey asked him Are you still alive.

07:01.030 --> 07:06.540
For example we have the problem a physical network adapter of the management that's me.

07:06.700 --> 07:14.620
The host is I host does not have any connection with the network but due to other network adapter of

07:14.620 --> 07:17.550
the virtual machine still work perfectly.

07:17.650 --> 07:25.180
And on the virtual machine and do still exist in this has worked perfectly there is a must that need

07:25.360 --> 07:27.790
to reboot to switch a machine and not the host.

07:27.820 --> 07:34.180
Of course not we know that the virtual machine still.

07:34.240 --> 07:41.620
Of course we have a modern other the tool spews application that we send a pink or a headbutt to the

07:41.620 --> 07:47.170
defendant's virtual machine to detect our dispatching machine work but this is more complicated and

07:47.350 --> 07:58.120
need a high performance of the network etc. but the normal situation the muster will send another how

07:58.120 --> 08:05.320
to beat another pink not trough the Internet but Drog the cable connected to do shit in storage.

08:05.590 --> 08:13.550
This is the intelligence of the day and were used shared storage has our network between two different

08:13.550 --> 08:15.230
tasks.

08:15.310 --> 08:21.460
So the Master will send are being held to the shared storage.

08:21.590 --> 08:27.230
Ask please do is the hardest number one still work.

08:27.480 --> 08:34.570
Its trust with takes out a virtual machine running into slave number one work at least here will tend

08:34.570 --> 08:35.210
to the mustard.

08:35.230 --> 08:38.380
Yes the host number one worked perfectly.

08:38.380 --> 08:39.800
So the muster no.

08:39.830 --> 08:44.310
Thus the last number one work perfectly even.

08:44.350 --> 08:48.240
There are no connection between the host and network.

08:48.560 --> 08:53.320
So we know that there's something wrong only about management or the cable out of management.

08:53.530 --> 08:59.420
But the difference between a machine that the company need worked perfectly.

08:59.800 --> 09:07.600
So it will not take any action and wait until the administrators of the network fix the problem for

09:07.600 --> 09:14.660
example gets to the cable back to work or fix the port management or network adapter etc..

09:14.920 --> 09:23.120
So he sent a word be be the internet cable and also drug do shared storage.

09:23.230 --> 09:28.390
Of course as I told you all the virtual machines will be in the shut its doors so you automatically

09:28.390 --> 09:33.890
detect that this virtual machine is still running perfectly Droguet the House number one.

09:33.930 --> 09:41.800
So note that this is work perfectly but when hate detects that this is our service then give it another

09:41.800 --> 09:42.720
chance drug.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.490
Shit its taught us at different that this hose is out of service.

09:46.570 --> 09:55.030
Then he will take action and reboot of the virtual machine in the host but in another situation that's

09:55.350 --> 09:55.960
to do that.

09:55.970 --> 10:03.730
He used another and said how to debate me the management or the cable responsible for the management

10:03.730 --> 10:05.690
of this host is out of service.

10:05.710 --> 10:12.550
All the virtual machines still work perfectly and they must not have a problem to connect to this shit

10:12.580 --> 10:13.260
it's.

10:13.420 --> 10:18.410
So all the connection between the master slave is not available.

10:18.550 --> 10:22.600
In this case there are are hard to beat that sundeck to do.

10:22.600 --> 10:29.900
Virtual Machine is a madrassa one that is some application and some of them were true etc..

10:29.920 --> 10:35.460
But this it will be more powerful and more danger.

10:35.530 --> 10:42.800
For example some situation will make a note etc and it will complicate your environment a lot so this

10:42.790 --> 10:47.440
when we use it to being to send a link to the difference between a machine in a heartbeat.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.020
To not Alda's your machine work perfectly.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.810
If yes then he keep using slave hours.

10:52.810 --> 10:54.970
It still work.

10:55.070 --> 11:01.660
If not he will take action and chose another server to run to different virtual machine.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.750
So this is the idea of the master and slave.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.900
And of course we the muster take is down he will chose another one to be the master.

11:09.110 --> 11:14.350
So in the next week you will start the practical step to see a real example of ADO.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.200
Hide Amoebe too soon to be.
