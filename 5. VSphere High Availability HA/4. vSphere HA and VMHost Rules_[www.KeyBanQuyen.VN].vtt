WEBVTT

00:01.590 --> 00:02.450
Hell.

00:02.500 --> 00:08.920
So no let's start the practical step of this heights of VB.

00:09.020 --> 00:16.040
So the Visby has as the same as the dress we need to go to the cluster as I told you not fear heights

00:16.070 --> 00:24.990
of ability are clustered in the cluster and in the config we have this fear of ability to do DNS.

00:25.100 --> 00:31.270
So the fact is we need to enable that is already part up so we need to turn it on.

00:31.610 --> 00:35.670
But before we start using this fear hides.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.810
I really think we need to be careful.

00:38.810 --> 00:41.620
We do rule of the dearest.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.510
We need to go right ahead.

00:44.610 --> 00:53.210
Hosts are rude and we need to take careful about the route of the dress because the action of this fear

00:53.240 --> 00:56.240
heart of a reality will have a conflict.

00:56.540 --> 00:57.290
We do.

00:57.290 --> 01:04.340
There is room for example in our situation we have only the hosts and for example we create a rule that

01:05.000 --> 01:08.160
virtual machine should never be in the same host.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.380
That's Auntie affinity in this host.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.110
That's me.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.970
But the first Mushin in do is I want to sing the machine into E-6 I do and to turn the machine in do

01:17.100 --> 01:18.970
is X I number three.

01:18.980 --> 01:27.050
But in any situation for example the host number one tickets down the height of ability should take

01:27.170 --> 01:33.120
all the vitrine machine in this host and reboot them in the other two hosts.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.920
Then we have our conflict with this rule.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.860
One of the virtual machine that exists in the host what will be with a modern machine that should not

01:41.870 --> 01:42.130
be.

01:42.140 --> 01:46.450
We did in the same host and this will give us another.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.160
So for that we need to disable.

01:50.190 --> 01:54.030
I go on deservers this one to avoid any problem.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.020
Dropped to.

01:55.190 --> 02:01.340
But of course in the right environment you will take your attention for the different route and this

02:01.640 --> 02:05.140
conflict will be less when you have more Hulst more.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.810
Yes I have asked for a number of big companies that have thousands.

02:08.960 --> 02:16.850
So rude even to create some rule for three or five Mushin to not be in the same host the highest operability

02:16.910 --> 02:24.330
will have more choice of the different physical Haast to to the virtual machine in separate halls.

02:24.350 --> 02:33.960
Even those that have destry virtual machine have more place to reboot theme inside older is host.

02:34.130 --> 02:37.450
So for that we deserved this one too of with any problem.

02:37.450 --> 02:41.780
Krol dictatorial because we have a simple situation.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.760
Only treat it because I host.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.070
So we go through this and we click it to turn it on.
