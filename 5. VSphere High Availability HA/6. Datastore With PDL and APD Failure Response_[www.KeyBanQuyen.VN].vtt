00:02.790 --> 00:03.700
Blogging.

00:04.160 --> 00:10.720
So before we start the next one we forget to mention some information right.

00:11.030 --> 00:11.530
Yes.

00:11.540 --> 00:19.750
When we talk about the master and the slave and we say that we in this house take it down.

00:20.060 --> 00:24.690
Then the master will power on the virtual machine exists in this house.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.830
In other host even though the center server is out of service.

00:29.870 --> 00:38.490
So how do muster know that the slave Hovda vitrine machine A B and C so for that we we config do that

00:38.550 --> 00:46.820
ability of the Vicent or Sayreville it automatically creates a text file into a shared storage that

00:47.390 --> 00:51.750
content all the information about the virtual machine and the host.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.300
So in that text.

00:53.300 --> 00:53.710
Right.

00:53.830 --> 00:59.930
Hey Chris do hosts muster Hovda virtual machine X Y and Z.

01:00.110 --> 01:04.190
The slave host of the virtual machine.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.280
And oh then the slave number you have the vitrine machine A B and C.

01:10.490 --> 01:13.200
So that's fine is save it in do.

01:13.430 --> 01:14.570
Shit it's trash.

01:14.660 --> 01:23.000
And this is I host in that cluster that can easy read that file and know which virtual machine in which

01:23.120 --> 01:24.200
the Center stood.

01:24.200 --> 01:31.810
So if this muster tickets than slave writer and this one will detects that the muster is to get done

01:32.120 --> 01:36.510
and he will get all the information about the vitriol machine in the muster.

01:36.620 --> 01:47.410
Rhonda textfile Khaled list so if we go to the second option we have in the heights of ability to respond

01:47.410 --> 01:55.560
for house is relation host is Rhaetian response allow you to configure the cluster to respond to host

01:55.560 --> 01:57.040
network exaltation.

01:57.810 --> 02:05.420
If you remember when we talk about the hosts file sometimes we have only do network fire a lot of we

02:05.590 --> 02:12.610
this host this mean this host is insulated from the network and the hostile work the vitriol machines

02:12.640 --> 02:14.450
departed on without any problem.

02:14.550 --> 02:22.240
Only we have a problem of the connection between the slave this host and the other is I host and the

02:22.300 --> 02:30.780
network in that case we have striation horse Israel-Egypt and not a horse filer for that we have options.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.520
Of course the first one is desirable.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.890
That's mean no action will be taken and affects V.M..

02:35.940 --> 02:36.810
That's me.

02:36.810 --> 02:40.930
Don't do anything for the virtual machine the site that host.

02:40.950 --> 02:48.400
Then we have the second option shut down and restart VM are affected VM will be gracefully shut down

02:48.580 --> 02:49.860
and Wickwire.

02:50.130 --> 02:55.850
Will attempt to restart the vim's on homes that are still online.

02:56.170 --> 03:02.900
But I mean it will shut down send a command to shut down the virtual machine exist in that host.

03:02.980 --> 03:10.020
Then when the virtual machine shuts down and pour it on in another horse in this situation we use it.

03:10.050 --> 03:16.590
If we are for example under the protection system we do application and we know that this application

03:16.680 --> 03:24.720
will have a corruption if we bought it off when we used both of those men we employ the power for that

03:24.720 --> 03:25.130
machine.

03:25.140 --> 03:32.430
It shut it down then actually without need to wait for one or two minutes to complete the process of

03:32.520 --> 03:33.820
shut down.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.950
This is the option shut down.

03:35.960 --> 03:42.800
Then we have the option powered it off and restart this part of its like you plugged the cable of the

03:42.900 --> 03:49.690
electricity from the virtual machine in one comment less than one second to a virtual machine with repotted.

03:49.890 --> 03:56.840
Then you restart the virtual machine in a different host that have connection.

03:56.850 --> 04:03.030
So in any situation that we lost the connection from this cable or from the which it does not have connection

04:03.030 --> 04:04.450
with the host.

04:04.500 --> 04:11.000
Even the hostile work perfectly and all the visual machines departed on this action will be it.

04:11.220 --> 04:14.470
Thats mean shut down or fall off.

04:15.930 --> 04:25.620
Sometimes And the most commonly it is to lose power of because in a situation is shut down sometimes

04:25.680 --> 04:32.640
as we know some machine when you send a command to shut down the process of shutdown have a problem

04:32.700 --> 04:33.810
and give you a massage.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.930
We tend to click on two choice.

04:36.930 --> 04:43.200
For example do message say please do you want to save the content of this document.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.700
For example in Microsoft Word the machine will not going to power it.

04:47.900 --> 04:55.770
We're not going to shut down and we seem to chose yes or no for that Dokument or that's a Microsoft

04:55.770 --> 04:57.450
Word in distribution.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.020
Do derrieres we'll wait.

05:00.120 --> 05:07.020
The shut down on Brijesh and before restarting it in another post and this can be take Howard or maybe

05:07.140 --> 05:12.140
Alda day maybe once a month without a portion of the vitriol machine.

05:12.330 --> 05:20.860
So always of common is power olf that's mean power of the virtual machine and posted on for use in AIDS

05:20.940 --> 05:22.150
in our company.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.600
For example some machine that need to be use it.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.040
For example the Chester server.

05:27.300 --> 05:34.020
If we wait until it shut down and have a problem so we'll have our exchange server out of service so

05:34.050 --> 05:35.110
when to power it up.

05:35.160 --> 05:42.690
Then restart the virtual machine and have the exchange available after three or four minutes in our

05:42.690 --> 05:43.470
company.

05:43.830 --> 05:46.100
Then we have another option.

05:46.190 --> 05:54.620
I tap that do that I store PDL and datastore we IPD it's close this one and we open just one.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.880
So the US thought we'd be the end.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.940
That's mean permanent device loss.

06:01.050 --> 06:07.440
We have a situation another situation if you see the one that this Haast have disconnected to the network

06:07.680 --> 06:15.890
but still work perfectly the situation that we have had for us is that this Hulst still have connection

06:15.890 --> 06:26.070
with do a work but he lose connection to do that or store the shit it look that's mean does not have

06:26.100 --> 06:28.450
any connection with the body of the Vissarion machine.

06:28.470 --> 06:31.980
So we created the virtual machine the hate and the body.

06:32.010 --> 06:38.010
We cut it down so all the virtual machine will be date of the virtual machine will be out of service.

06:38.040 --> 06:46.530
Even the House is still working perfectly the Master sent the herd to the slave and the slave said yes

06:46.590 --> 06:53.610
I'm still alive but all the virtual machine is out of service because we have a filer between the slave

06:53.760 --> 06:54.860
and the device.

06:55.020 --> 07:02.010
So we have a situation we have the device Paramount's device Los lets me he does not have connection

07:02.490 --> 07:04.720
to do device in this situation.

07:04.740 --> 07:11.370
We have the option of course by default is disable no action will be take it to the affected virtual

07:11.370 --> 07:12.890
machine.

07:13.350 --> 07:20.040
Thats mean its only give you a message that there are Vitry on the machine that is out of service because

07:20.190 --> 07:23.670
we have at that store we'd be the fire alarm response.

07:23.690 --> 07:27.120
This just gives you an event to know about it.

07:27.300 --> 07:32.660
But the action that we have is power of understanding between machine that's mean are affected.

07:32.670 --> 07:39.000
Virtual Machine will be terminated and this year of ability will attempt to restart the virtual machine

07:39.150 --> 07:40.020
on hauz.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.920
You'll have connectivity to do that.

07:43.620 --> 07:50.320
You see here we don't have shut down because the virtual machine Amerie the power of Alamoudi kill it

07:50.700 --> 07:53.910
by losing the connection between hate and Abadie.

07:54.060 --> 07:55.650
So I'll derivate your machine.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.650
It is bolted.

07:56.850 --> 07:57.720
The action.

07:57.720 --> 08:05.220
If there are some vitch and instead voted on please part of them and restart them in another host that

08:05.520 --> 08:10.080
have connection with do that are stock right.

08:10.230 --> 08:17.520
For example this one is firelit But when you want to restart a virtual machine that's already exists

08:17.520 --> 08:18.660
in this host.

08:18.660 --> 08:24.150
It will check in the top connection with decide that for example if you have a mother tree.

08:24.210 --> 08:31.110
I host if one of them does not have connection with this that does logically this virtual machine we're

08:31.110 --> 08:34.540
not going to report it on inside that server.

08:34.710 --> 08:39.600
So logically it will restart the virtual machine inside the other hosts that have connection.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.300
We do that for example in this one.

08:42.330 --> 08:45.390
And in this one that's have our connection.

08:45.660 --> 08:52.900
Then the other option right head of course we leave this one disable the other one that we have right

08:52.900 --> 08:59.030
there is do all beat down fight response to that.

08:59.040 --> 09:07.380
I start with APD all paid down to situations that mean the store is out of service.

09:07.420 --> 09:14.120
I mean we have a far left Abdula bit overdue that the US or Dusan or ice Khazaee or the storage public

09:14.240 --> 09:18.400
etc. This was a problem and it is out of service.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.330
That's mean.

09:19.370 --> 09:25.920
ALDA vitrine machine exists in this one is powered off and out of service industry.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.560
Of course this is a hard situation.

09:30.660 --> 09:31.800
We have the Zevi.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.620
As always we have events that mean gets you on that occasion.

09:35.680 --> 09:44.190
Then part of that is of vitriol machine conservative restart Polisi and aggressive restart policy.

09:44.190 --> 09:50.730
In this situation it will send a commode and keep track the connection.

09:50.730 --> 09:57.360
We thought that store and all the virtual machine exist in the store to power up and restart.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.540
We have concerts.

09:58.650 --> 09:59.270
That's me.

09:59.300 --> 10:04.800
Did this action slowly and aggressively do with as fast as possible.

10:05.950 --> 10:12.830
Are affected virtual machine would get rid of and Visby it has been it will attempt to restart VM if

10:13.010 --> 10:16.440
the host has connectivity to do that a start.

10:16.780 --> 10:25.690
I mean when this store is out of service and lost all the connection with this one if any Hulst Zeuxis

10:25.770 --> 10:27.460
do have a connection with this.

10:27.460 --> 10:32.600
That does not mean that those stores start responding to one of those hosts.

10:32.750 --> 10:38.970
For example I have no doubt about Indu network adapter the network adapter took it down.

10:38.990 --> 10:42.580
Only one that still work with a another host.

10:42.590 --> 10:43.370
In that situation.

10:43.430 --> 10:49.960
Will try to restart the virtual machine inside that host that have connection with this that.

10:50.030 --> 10:58.330
So he will try to arrest Bardos between machine inside that home that will get a connectivity to do

10:58.360 --> 10:59.250
that Astar.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.370
We have to consider what that's mean.

11:01.480 --> 11:08.110
Slowly they will wait aspecific time and check if you did that or Starbucks to the light because sometimes

11:08.110 --> 11:14.950
we only have a problem with network or the datastore have a freezing then it's need a little time to

11:14.950 --> 11:16.020
get back to the live.

11:16.060 --> 11:19.540
So we chose conservative to give it our time.

11:19.570 --> 11:22.590
Chick is really the story is out of service.

11:22.750 --> 11:27.560
If not we used to power of aggressive restart.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.460
What do you see that's mean it will do it as fast as possible.

11:31.570 --> 11:33.880
Then we have the wrist band recovery.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.500
It's integration about are they done.

11:36.850 --> 11:37.860
That's mean.

11:37.870 --> 11:45.820
When we chose deserver that's mean do response recovery will not start automatically.

11:45.830 --> 11:53.960
We'll wait three minutes before restart the virtual machine and bought it on and datastore that is fine.

11:54.170 --> 11:54.930
That's mean.

11:55.090 --> 12:05.520
If that stored back to life after a moment he will wait three minutes before he starts taking the recovery

12:05.520 --> 12:12.210
step recovery process and restart the vitriol machine in that store and use it as our men.

12:12.210 --> 12:15.740
That does not mean he used the star in the environment.

12:15.750 --> 12:22.510
He should wait three minutes before a restart intervention machine and using Indu preview place that

12:22.640 --> 12:24.100
this was before.

12:24.330 --> 12:31.320
But when we chose restart that's meant automatically when he detects Ah datastore back to the life he

12:31.320 --> 12:38.750
will restart the virtual machine and put it on in the right server that it was before.

12:38.760 --> 12:45.330
So of course we should always chose three minutes because we need to be sure that our store is ready

12:45.660 --> 12:47.230
to walk again.

12:47.430 --> 12:54.480
But sometimes if we have a small number of store for example have only two at the store we need to restart

12:54.500 --> 13:01.200
division machine as quick as possible because some virtual machine will still powered it off and we

13:01.200 --> 13:03.780
do not want to wait three minutes before.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.380
Stop audit on this virtual machine.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.910
In other server.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.370
So this is a different option that we have and we'll discover more in the next week.
