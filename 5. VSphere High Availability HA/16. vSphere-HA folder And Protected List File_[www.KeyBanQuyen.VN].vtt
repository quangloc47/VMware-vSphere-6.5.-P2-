Blogging so I know that information after configuring to be free and that's it.

00:06.990 --> 00:11.490
And this fear chose the master one then to just connected to the master.

00:11.640 --> 00:19.280
And I told you that when the muster as out of series even to this point of service is out of service.

00:19.320 --> 00:26.460
The other two are connected to muster can detect this information and chose under there must have been

00:26.660 --> 00:30.600
rebozo division or Mashi that exist into must that host.

00:30.660 --> 00:36.230
And how does the host know the information about the virtual machine inside this house.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.000
So if we back to that start like that and we got to the Sherrod story use it for the head.

00:43.260 --> 00:49.500
If we go to the monitor or we try to browse information about this one.

00:49.640 --> 00:55.150
How do you see that we have a fire carried this fear heights of ability of the it.

00:55.190 --> 00:55.990
We do this.

00:56.020 --> 01:00.960
It hides a beat when we click on it we see different phyla.

01:01.170 --> 01:08.770
This one we have different file save it in the shedded stores that have information about this.

01:09.030 --> 01:17.480
So this is obviously no monarchy's by do different tasks and not by do the center server.

01:17.550 --> 01:26.010
So hey if we check this fine I-10 we have Haast 35 boated on a hot 28 protected list and this is the

01:26.010 --> 01:32.970
fight that I tell you that have a list of information about the host and the different virtual machine

01:33.180 --> 01:34.550
running in this house.

01:34.800 --> 01:42.340
So despite all the information about the muster the vitriol machine the horse into the hides.

01:42.840 --> 01:48.830
So we do muster is out of service the two other slave will go to decide.

01:49.020 --> 01:56.730
And read information about the video machine that walking in to horse muster and well reviewed today

01:56.850 --> 02:01.840
in other different tools and building the one that will be the master.

02:02.070 --> 02:05.430
So this is the file that we told you.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.820
This is a different affirmation about the house the spot at all.

02:08.830 --> 02:09.890
Tell us about it.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.730
Maybe just what is the number one.

02:12.810 --> 02:13.790
Number two.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.350
Number three went another host is both of they will get some information about it when it is out of

02:19.350 --> 02:24.850
service and when it's back to the live they will get information from those fine 10.
