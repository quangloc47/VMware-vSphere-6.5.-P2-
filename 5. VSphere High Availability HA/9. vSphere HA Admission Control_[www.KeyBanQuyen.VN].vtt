00:00.840 --> 00:01.640
Help again.

00:01.860 --> 00:08.540
So the next option that we have in the fist bit height of ability is to add the mission control.

00:08.550 --> 00:15.560
So the admission control is up what you see usually the by the spirit of ability to ensure final overcapacity

00:15.580 --> 00:16.680
within our cluster.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.990
So it's increasing the value of the host by.

00:20.250 --> 00:25.800
Tolerate with increase of ability constant and capacity reserve reserved.

00:26.190 --> 00:32.500
So if you remember when is the pro active file and response right there.

00:32.700 --> 00:40.740
We make some decision to go to the horse in the current mode or in dimensional mode set up so the admission

00:41.280 --> 00:42.700
how it's walk.

00:43.080 --> 00:50.470
If we're about to dig into my tent and when we talk about the height of ability we talk about do three

00:50.470 --> 00:53.840
issues in our cluster or in our environment.

00:54.090 --> 01:02.040
So I think meaning you should have some free resource in your environment if you have 0 percent of the

01:02.040 --> 01:02.590
roosters.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.990
So you don't have any height of ability in your environment.

01:06.330 --> 01:13.310
So how do other mission control work or what's at mission control.

01:13.860 --> 01:20.520
When we config the hides reality in our cluster like this one for example just example we have three

01:20.740 --> 01:27.960
servers in our environment and we enabled the height of ability and we configured at the Mission Control

01:29.410 --> 01:36.410
puts me in a situation that when Haast take it down the height of ability will make great.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.120
All we're rebooted the virtual machine inside this house.

01:40.150 --> 01:42.160
In other Haast we have.

01:42.400 --> 01:49.930
So that's me in a situation for example we have three hosts every hosts consume about 60 percent of

01:49.930 --> 01:51.180
the resource.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.890
But to me it just has we have 14 percent or 3 resouce.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.530
This has also we have 14 percent of every resource.

01:58.720 --> 02:05.920
And this host again also have 14 percent of priesthoods that's mean it consume 16 percent of the resource

02:06.450 --> 02:08.890
when we have a problem in one of these hoes.

02:08.890 --> 02:12.630
For example this host have a filer what's happened.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.700
Did it when separate.

02:14.800 --> 02:23.440
Do virtual machine in this host end to host but it will make calculation to use this free resource that

02:23.440 --> 02:24.160
we have right here.

02:24.160 --> 02:30.110
We have 14 percent of users but we have had 16 percent of the resource.

02:30.310 --> 02:37.350
So it really was separate to 18 percent rating and 13 percent of the research was 10.

02:37.600 --> 02:44.140
So to make it more clear for example we have four virtual machine Aldus for a machine consume the same

02:44.280 --> 02:44.990
results.

02:45.010 --> 02:51.970
That's mean to part of this reason is about 16 bottoms and of course we have similar hosts this hosts

02:52.030 --> 02:55.340
are as the same as power and resource.

02:55.770 --> 03:01.150
That's mean I would support a virtual machine to run in this host and the other to have a virtual machine

03:01.150 --> 03:02.980
to run in this host.

03:03.130 --> 03:10.450
So we have the equality of the resource but in that situation we have consumed 98 percent of the resource

03:10.480 --> 03:14.070
in this host 98 percent of the resource of this world.

03:14.110 --> 03:19.800
So we only have 10 percent of resouce when this has to get done.

03:19.910 --> 03:27.850
Do ability can't reboot this virtual machine in all the holes because it is not spent any real resource.

03:27.940 --> 03:31.010
So we do not have any height of ability in this region.
