00:01.450 --> 00:02.210
Blogging.

00:02.490 --> 00:11.760
So as I told you it is always recommended to visit VM where documentation and get more information off

00:11.800 --> 00:15.330
the software from the source they actually.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.030
So for that we go through google with V.M. where it will take you to the documentation of the VM where

00:21.300 --> 00:28.260
all you can go from this Nanc doc VM where dot com VM where you for the index.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.900
So the same you can get it this way and then search for the VM where you spend category or you can go

00:33.900 --> 00:42.270
directly to the start VM where dot com slash English slash VM where slash index dot each amount.

00:42.390 --> 00:48.000
So this is the VM where the condition of the VM where this fit we have different mission.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.360
Right.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.130
Do you see these fears.

00:50.190 --> 00:56.230
6.5 we have this year old and this year five point five.

00:56.580 --> 01:05.100
So as we cover into core the latest version into Tuireann that means a 6.5 we go that lets you do this

01:05.340 --> 01:10.590
6.5 and get to do the ties from the content of the document.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.210
So we have different information.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.150
High end of the center server.

01:15.420 --> 01:18.770
Thats what we cover in the top part of the course.

01:18.780 --> 01:24.750
The first one and the second one we talk about is I do the center server.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.280
Then we have this year up.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.940
Manager of course we talk a little about the updates manager but of course there are more details to

01:32.940 --> 01:35.030
discover from the documentation.

01:35.040 --> 01:43.440
We also have virtual sun and the spirit of protection does get that our protection is the backup software.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.750
Its talk about the different backup software that you can use with VM with the individuals.

01:49.830 --> 01:55.980
We didn't score this topic because it is not in the scope or the goals they then the VM Ware updates

01:55.980 --> 01:58.090
manager and do is excite.

01:58.260 --> 02:05.500
So if you click on it I and the decenter have a lot of information right here the configuration maximum.

02:05.670 --> 02:09.510
So you can click on the configuration maximun to get details about it.

02:09.510 --> 02:12.010
You see a lot of detail right here.

02:12.060 --> 02:16.350
Of course we cover some of them but not on all of them.

02:16.620 --> 02:21.210
So you can check this one by one or you can simply click on this.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.790
Pick the name right here.

02:22.790 --> 02:25.470
You don't know do the documentation.

02:25.470 --> 02:32.190
So if you click on it it will take your to do the documentation of all this if you want to read the

02:32.190 --> 02:34.130
content from a PDA.

02:37.300 --> 02:42.290
So is it the documentation of the configuration Maximov is about 25 page.

02:42.370 --> 02:46.760
It is always Oracle wanted to read the content from the documentation.

02:46.870 --> 02:52.980
So if we check the content as quick as possible you see an addiction victory and machine maximum How

02:53.030 --> 03:00.100
watch Veggie and machine maximum you can use X I Hulst muxing mom to compute maximal memory storage

03:00.100 --> 03:01.230
network etc..

03:01.460 --> 03:02.760
A lot lot of information.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.000
So for example let's check this one.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.760
So the different hardware Maximov for our virtual machine.

03:09.760 --> 03:19.500
So virtual Sibiu part virtual machine should not be more than one hundred twenty eight spew then how

03:19.500 --> 03:20.470
much RAM.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.560
It's about six terabytes.

03:22.620 --> 03:28.770
That's mean you can't create a virtual machine with more than six terabytes if you do this via 6.5.

03:28.770 --> 03:36.450
Of course in the older version it's will be less than six terabytes in the six want or in the 5.5.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.150
It will be less than that.

03:38.180 --> 03:45.090
But then how much vitriol is caused the other virtual machine how much vitriol and how much is it that

03:45.090 --> 03:52.310
a lot of information then for example where we check this one about do I host.

03:52.380 --> 04:01.300
So how much are Hosken support for logicals super perhaps is about five hundred seventy six spewed.

04:01.500 --> 04:10.410
Then how much virtual machine part has you can create up to 24 virtual machine for every horse that

04:10.730 --> 04:12.660
had 6.5.

04:12.840 --> 04:18.830
Then you can create up to four thousand ninety six that you see.

04:18.930 --> 04:19.580
That's me.

04:19.590 --> 04:26.880
You can create a virtual machine with any number of spew but the thought of the video spew in all virtual

04:26.880 --> 04:32.250
machine in that host should not be more than four thousand ninety six.

04:32.430 --> 04:38.560
Then virtual see barcode etc. then the filters if you remember we talk about default but it also lets

04:38.560 --> 04:43.930
me the maximum hardware for every virtual machine that can be used for the photo runs if you remember

04:44.060 --> 04:52.690
16 that you are a disk to terabytes for the disk size for Sibiu bought a virtual machine 64 gigabytes

04:52.810 --> 05:00.060
virtual machine and for a virtual machine for me you can enable up to four virtual machine inside that

05:00.060 --> 05:04.090
host and eight Super you host.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.330
Then I mean more around.

05:07.380 --> 05:11.590
Remember we create our host with four right of.

05:11.820 --> 05:17.600
But you can create a host with lots twirl.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.670
There are a byte from the storage etc. there are a lot lot of useful information that you can get from

05:23.670 --> 05:24.690
the documentation.

05:24.690 --> 05:29.140
So it is always recommended to check to condition.

05:29.670 --> 05:36.200
So and this is the difference information about the maximum of every service of the view.

05:36.660 --> 05:39.240
Then you can check the other information.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.520
Let's take this one

05:43.280 --> 05:48.720
they'll have the astonishment and set up we cover the installation and set up what is right and center

05:49.030 --> 05:56.770
the upgrade if you want to upgrade the spare five or five or six or two and the newer version 6.5.

05:56.810 --> 06:03.240
The point of view center server and host management we talk about is the server appliance configuration.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.150
We cover a little quick about the center instead of an appliance.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.190
When we asked old appliance fast action about a recent or separate appliance platform service control

06:13.240 --> 06:17.730
the mission the virtual machine administration will host profile.

06:17.730 --> 06:24.510
If you remember our fall section about hospital if I don't networking to Stahl's we talk about the difference.

06:24.560 --> 06:31.940
I've been able to Visby security we didn't cover the security because it's about complexity of the post-war

06:32.100 --> 06:33.690
times out of the station.

06:33.690 --> 06:41.760
That's mean if you leave your central server can't open and leave it for some minutes it will close

06:41.790 --> 06:43.490
automatically the station.

06:43.950 --> 06:49.310
So you can get more details about this for security for your security resource management.

06:49.320 --> 06:55.370
That's me and a derrieres eyes are really disparate ability the monitoring and the performance.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.050
It's about the monitoring of the different tours.

06:59.310 --> 07:07.680
Also for using some service like the really operation management etc. the single host management trouble

07:07.740 --> 07:08.990
sruti and that's me.

07:09.030 --> 07:11.750
If you have a problem how to fix that.

07:11.790 --> 07:16.870
Shooting of course we can't cope are a different issue that we can have in the real environment.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.900
We make a little about it.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.220
For example if you want.

07:20.250 --> 07:24.820
Nobody knows how to mix up troubleshooting to enable the fault.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.280
But it does not match your machine.

07:26.280 --> 07:31.990
That does not accept default like in plugged us be disconnected.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.410
CD disabled the hot plugging etc..

07:35.670 --> 07:39.050
So you can get more trouble shooting from this one.

07:39.060 --> 07:42.330
Then you have additional resources and do the formats.

07:42.420 --> 07:49.810
All those documents right there you can't get them PTF formatted operation maximum despues from networking

07:49.840 --> 07:57.630
to bit storage security etc. you can simply click on any of this one and you will download the file

07:57.720 --> 07:59.540
of this documentation.

07:59.880 --> 08:08.600
So my request is to go and check Aldo's thank or try to download the app if you like to read Canton's

08:08.610 --> 08:12.740
from the pre-death download all the speedy documentation.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.770
I will try to share this link with you in discourse.

08:15.960 --> 08:24.840
But if you can't download those documents from Microsoft you can simply go to a doc lots VM way or dot

08:24.840 --> 08:25.470
com.

08:25.590 --> 08:29.880
The word is first last index and go to the version that you use.

08:29.880 --> 08:37.220
If you use an older version or a spare You can go to the old version and download Alda's documentation.

08:37.650 --> 08:42.840
So this is everything about the VM work fear in double quotes.

08:43.170 --> 08:52.320
And thank you for chosing my course to lead VM where visit from me and see you in the next new course.
