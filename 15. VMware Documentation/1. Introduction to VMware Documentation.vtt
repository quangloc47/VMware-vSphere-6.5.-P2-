Hello and welcome in this latest section of discourse so drop it of course we cover almost all the important

00:09.950 --> 00:11.730
future of the viewing world.

00:12.080 --> 00:21.170
But as we know it is impossible to cover every tank will cover all or most of the Mustang but not every

00:21.360 --> 00:23.760
tank.

00:23.960 --> 00:32.030
Also you should know that no matter our video course exists in the Internet can cover everything about

00:32.360 --> 00:41.210
them where or any of those far more software than the information exists in a text format or in a documentation

00:41.360 --> 00:42.200
format.

00:42.300 --> 00:50.150
So for those it is always recommended to back to the documentation of any software you use.

00:50.330 --> 00:59.440
In our situation we do VM where it is always recommended to back to the VM where documentation to get

00:59.450 --> 01:08.270
more details and more information like ADO academic information as we know any knowledge we have a hand

01:09.560 --> 01:15.340
experience knowledge and unacademic knowledge in due course.

01:15.410 --> 01:18.870
I share with you my hands on experience.

01:19.070 --> 01:27.060
But to get academic knowledge you need to back to the documentation of the VM and so far that we're

01:27.080 --> 01:33.590
going to discover a little about the documentation of the view and want to know about it.

01:33.710 --> 01:34.880
See you in the next video.
