00:00.830 --> 00:05.980
Not we simply try to comply and the host provides you our host.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.260
So in the preview what we do it's a deliberate of the host.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.500
That's one by one.

00:10.690 --> 00:16.180
But in real environments when you have thousands of E-6 a host you can't do it one by one by click on

00:16.180 --> 00:20.190
the host then attache the host profile and applied a chair etc..

00:20.320 --> 00:24.050
No you can't do it in the big environment from this place.

00:24.100 --> 00:31.960
You attach a host or the fall cluster without any problem more than a thousand or 2000 3000 years.

00:32.020 --> 00:41.080
My host then check apply as to know how much I host must apply to change how much I eat because I host

00:41.080 --> 00:43.600
Coldplay introduce introducer provide and so on.

00:43.660 --> 00:51.250
Then when you do stay up late to church is because I host you simply click right here remediate and

00:51.340 --> 00:54.270
it will give you the details to apply to change.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.850
You are E6 I host.

00:55.900 --> 01:02.410
So the first one is already compliant so we can check this one to avoid losing more time because it

01:02.410 --> 01:04.950
will reconfigure the same seasoning again.

01:05.110 --> 01:09.000
Then just one other day compliant then you will leave.

01:09.110 --> 01:16.060
All it does is not compliant or you can leave this one its not a problem because it will just repeat

01:16.090 --> 01:19.230
DO same sitting that already exists.

01:19.540 --> 01:27.910
So we click next then the check if you want to check in a compliant then finish to apply the configuration

01:28.540 --> 01:30.800
for the E-6 house and then Bertolli.

01:30.820 --> 01:38.980
So if you remember to host E6 I number three there is not have R is H and should enable it and also

01:38.980 --> 01:46.230
does not have a.p server so to check policies or complaints.

01:46.240 --> 01:54.460
No it's apply the hospital fine misconfiguration change applied host configuration change applied and

01:54.500 --> 01:59.470
saw it and saw.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.910
So the process is complete successfully.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.570
Of course there will chance to treat compliance and zero in compliance we just need to refresh to see

02:08.750 --> 02:09.410
the new one.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.550
So treat compliant 0 in compliance.

02:12.770 --> 02:20.700
So if you box with the host and will check sitting or is X I number three you seek is already the show

02:20.690 --> 02:28.130
that is X I shared for the host has been enabled and it is H for the host has been enabled.

02:28.130 --> 02:38.650
If you got to do that and time the seating time correlation it will be addressed 11 and the service

02:38.740 --> 02:39.820
is running.

02:40.180 --> 02:49.620
So this is the idea about the host profile is very simple you export the host providing you make it

02:49.620 --> 02:50.110
in.

02:50.130 --> 02:53.610
It shows the option that you want to apply to a different host.

02:53.640 --> 03:01.980
Then you attach the host profile to a difference is I halls and remediate the chance to those E6 I host.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.260
So this is simple true.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.830
It's very useful in the big environment.

03:07.830 --> 03:13.550
Sometimes it will start having some problem when you make a mistake in the configuration or you make

03:13.810 --> 03:15.530
a conflict setting.

03:15.740 --> 03:23.880
You just try to test them into this club then apply them in the right environment of what to apply the

03:23.900 --> 03:30.830
configuration in different environments to avoid losing or making a mistake in investments so always

03:31.040 --> 03:35.320
make a test in our Isak's I reached for the test.

03:35.510 --> 03:42.180
Then when you are sure that all the sitting is correct then you can apply them to the read environment.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.360
So in the next section.
