Hello and welcome again in this new section in this section we're going to talk a little about Hulst

00:08.560 --> 00:15.200
profile the host profiled is like when we create a template virtual machine.

00:15.250 --> 00:21.130
In the previous course we cover our fall section about cloning and a complete virtual machine how to

00:21.130 --> 00:23.070
create a complex picture machine.

00:23.080 --> 00:31.150
Also we cover how to create our customization specification file for every virtual machine.

00:31.150 --> 00:38.790
Also we can do the same step at the level of the host in the preview work a delivery of a virtual machine.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.930
Now we can create our profile for different tasks.

00:42.970 --> 00:49.810
Of course the value of a hospital fight it's not very important in a smart environment like this one

00:49.810 --> 00:51.660
that we have only tricky ethics.

00:51.850 --> 00:58.510
But induce big environment with 20 100 200 1000 physical hosts.

00:58.630 --> 01:01.920
It's very very useful to have a host profile.

01:02.080 --> 01:09.130
So when you're config different E6 I host you can simply do it one time and apply it.

01:09.460 --> 01:12.130
Are you is I host available.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.200
So how we get to host profile.

01:15.550 --> 01:18.670
We can't go to the home like that.

01:18.670 --> 01:22.080
Then we have our option create a hosts profile.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.580
So this is the highest profile.
