WEBVTT

00:00.350 --> 00:01.470
A lot again.

00:01.560 --> 00:05.820
So let's check the setting of a cost profile.

00:06.090 --> 00:11.650
So we click it sitting and of course you have the name and description.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.740
We click next.

00:12.870 --> 00:16.040
Then we have all the seating available in our house.

00:16.070 --> 00:16.710
All right.

00:16.730 --> 00:17.380
Right.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.330
So you see the different option.

00:19.410 --> 00:24.650
Of course you can create a favorite one to use it anytime you want it to sitting.

00:24.870 --> 00:31.400
But we're going to check all the seating so we have advance seating coffee if we check this one.

00:31.450 --> 00:37.620
We have lots of other ones sitting on the other ones that option are other ones that configuration you

00:37.620 --> 00:44.190
click on made you get a different configured that we have some of the to time out when you want to change

00:44.310 --> 00:48.520
the head to fit in our profile to use it.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.530
The volume is 19 of course.

00:50.530 --> 00:56.960
Does that mean you should take careful when you it them because this is something not for.

00:57.150 --> 01:03.360
You can destroy your environment if you make a wrong sitting this one that we can't cover them in discourse

01:03.750 --> 01:07.950
you can get information about them when you need them.

01:07.950 --> 01:13.680
Of course in the beginning you will not need to change any of the seating but by the time your environment

01:14.040 --> 01:17.170
goes up you need to make a small change in a specific place.

01:17.220 --> 01:24.780
Of course you get a recommendation from the company or from the software needed etc. then you can go

01:24.840 --> 01:27.600
and change a specific sitting in this place.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.950
But you should just careful when you needed those sitting.

01:32.400 --> 01:39.530
Then we have some configuration that input output configuration graphic hospital profile the formation

01:39.540 --> 01:41.000
about the host profile.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.930
That is it then for example General systemd the power configuration system.

01:47.970 --> 01:53.140
So you see the CPI should balance it or perform low power et cetera.

01:54.360 --> 02:01.230
So all the stitching of our is I host of people right here the generosity that that tried this option

02:01.470 --> 02:07.470
you can edit it for example where you see your coffee or fix it in a.p user must explicit.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.290
Charles what is the encryption.

02:09.480 --> 02:13.070
That's it all when the operator can add it to the end of it.

02:13.190 --> 02:22.140
And B to get the data on time from on a PC rather than a housecarls etc. there are a lot lot of information

02:22.150 --> 02:28.760
for example the network sitting on orders which we have only which is zero.

02:29.130 --> 02:33.730
We don't get it in if you switch into part of your course we call out information about this week.

02:33.750 --> 02:39.460
And the widgets which saw the switching off this is which if you remember when we create our visa which

02:39.740 --> 02:43.620
it's asked to you we give it to you by default.

02:43.620 --> 02:52.890
We use this number always greet object or a scene specific into the configuration how much LAN connected

02:52.900 --> 02:59.160
to the switch the VM annex 7 6 5 4 3 2 0.

02:59.430 --> 03:06.720
They chose the physical network with a given state etc. you have look a lot of other ones that option

03:07.110 --> 03:13.780
that you can't chose them one by one and it is then the number of port how much port network you see

03:13.980 --> 03:19.550
if we can ease in in it or see to enable a low Mach change that's mean to give you the ability to change

03:19.590 --> 03:20.060
the.

03:20.080 --> 03:25.050
Mark there's a difference between your machine if it is with this one division machine will not get

03:25.080 --> 03:32.550
any ability to change the MAC address plain reviews mod for guitars made etc. look a lot of information

03:32.970 --> 03:39.610
that you should take personally when you challenged them because of course you can't make the changes

03:39.610 --> 03:45.690
that you want in your club and you test love you can try to mix and change and see what will happen

03:46.020 --> 03:52.120
but you should be ready that you will destroy your love and you need to roll with it.

03:52.200 --> 03:58.880
Then of course the Wii's reach security and service and the storage configuration.

03:58.980 --> 04:04.540
The difference that doesn't exist is for example ice cores the initiator we could eat ice Kaze the NFL

04:04.590 --> 04:08.130
the virtual sand the software etc..

04:08.370 --> 04:10.620
So this is the content of a hospital.

04:10.620 --> 04:15.470
I remember when I told you that we're going to explore the config of holes.

04:15.510 --> 04:18.120
This is the difference config that we can.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.860
It is one by one.

04:20.160 --> 04:27.330
But of course as I told you when we tried to attach it to our host profile to different hosts we can't

04:27.730 --> 04:30.320
get older sitting for a different one.

04:30.330 --> 04:37.790
For example some of us sitting in a location about six hosts we can't attach it to another horse will

04:37.800 --> 04:45.570
give us an error like when we clone our virtual machine and we don't change ID when we is your virtual

04:45.570 --> 04:49.680
machine with the same ID we get in our environment.

04:49.710 --> 04:52.740
So we should take careful when you chose those one.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.370
Let's cancel this one.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.680
Of course you can make it up or we don't see it.

04:57.810 --> 05:04.770
And next we'll try to export a host profile and we'll see how to attach our profile to different E-6

05:04.770 --> 05:06.080
I host seemed an extra.
