00:01.770 --> 00:02.530
Blogging.

00:02.780 --> 00:08.030
So let's try to Attash Are you a host do this profile a fight.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.370
So we can't do it from this place.

00:10.460 --> 00:17.510
We got to do a host right there and we tried to Attash on detached hosts and cluster.

00:17.590 --> 00:23.920
If you remember this option because Attash are the cluster or a specific host of course here its only

00:24.280 --> 00:25.960
show your summer.

00:26.130 --> 00:30.350
What are we going to do it from the other why we got to do house and cluster

00:33.090 --> 00:39.040
chick dismissed doesn't write her.

00:39.100 --> 00:46.330
You see this warning that I shill for the host has been enabled and is is H for the horse has been in

00:46.330 --> 00:46.890
the cities.

00:47.020 --> 00:53.360
Of course we enable its edge and Isak's I showed for the studio.

00:53.530 --> 00:58.220
So we go to the heart that we want to attach cost profile to it.

00:58.240 --> 01:04.160
We click on Nates we got to host profile and we have Attash Holst's profile.

01:04.450 --> 01:07.170
So no we can chose this one.

01:07.210 --> 01:13.600
And of course it will not ask us for the customization because none of the hosts require additional

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
customization.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.870
That's mean we don't need to make any customization because the configuration exists in this profile

01:21.160 --> 01:24.620
does not have any conflict with different hosts.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.290
So it's what perfect.

01:26.350 --> 01:33.970
Of course a lot of time when you attach our hospital files to a host almost a lot of time will ask you

01:33.970 --> 01:35.150
to reboot.

01:35.310 --> 01:41.300
E-6 I host it with food Isak's I holes in Dement and a smoke and will Magness the difference between

01:41.300 --> 01:48.760
a machine exists in that house and another is a host that will reboot this want to apply new configuration

01:48.760 --> 01:49.430
change.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.330
So we click Finish and not we have a sheet.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.110
Our hosts profile 2 is x.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.330
I host them all.

01:57.370 --> 02:03.900
So if we click on this host and go to hospital 5 we have the new option available.

02:03.940 --> 02:10.570
Church hosts provide that I mean we just need to disconnect the previewer hospital fight and utter shit

02:10.600 --> 02:11.670
on no one.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.150
We control this one.

02:13.160 --> 02:18.160
We mediate this mean applied to change that exists in the hospital.

02:18.280 --> 02:25.110
So we apply the conflagration from the hospital fight in this host of course this option with Dway Diptosh

02:25.190 --> 02:31.470
us profile thats when you want to do this profile from this is because I host.

02:31.720 --> 02:38.410
It's like we're back to the previous state check Haast profile compliance lets me check if there are

02:38.470 --> 02:43.080
any change that can be applied from the host profile if we connect.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.620
That has provided we get it right not to.

02:46.860 --> 02:52.510
I one will not have any change will be applied because its the same configuration.

02:52.630 --> 03:00.010
But in this work we have some difference if we check to profit compliance will have some change then

03:00.010 --> 03:01.550
the rest it has customization.

03:01.570 --> 03:08.660
You want to restate those comments musician to the pre-drawn export that has customisation to export

03:08.660 --> 03:16.380
to customisation outside idiot hosts customisation it is any customization for all that of course.

03:16.390 --> 03:22.440
You can actually use AXO musician fight like the one that we use for our military machine.

03:22.780 --> 03:32.210
So lets try to make it too complex before that lets go back to hospital find us or find returned and

03:32.210 --> 03:33.770
we chose this one.

03:33.770 --> 03:41.260
You see in Kano State House is one click on that you get details about the Haast connected or cluster

03:41.360 --> 03:43.900
if we chose the cluster you will find this right here.

03:43.940 --> 03:44.900
We got to Samari.

03:44.930 --> 03:48.850
No we have no state about compliance.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.440
So we need to make our check compliance.

03:51.440 --> 03:57.020
We can do it from the host directly or we can simply click Check hospital profile compliance.

03:57.110 --> 03:58.390
So we click on that.

03:58.760 --> 04:07.190
It will check the compliance of the host profile we host number two and give you the data about its

04:09.500 --> 04:11.740
So what is it.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.010
Is it true compliance.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.140
So what I do is not compliance.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.050
We do other shit profile.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.910
I mean there are some change between this hospital five and six.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.240
I hope that we connect to it.

04:27.370 --> 04:28.160
That's me.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.000
It's not compliance for 100 percent.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.060
There are some different configuration between the host and hosts profile.

04:36.170 --> 04:39.870
But I mean we need to apply the configuration.

04:40.090 --> 04:49.350
So if we back to when I turn to the host and we click on the x i Horstmann but you will see our massaged

04:49.360 --> 04:53.200
Haast is not in compliance with the attachment profile.

04:53.390 --> 04:56.890
I mean there are some change between the holes and profile.

04:57.340 --> 05:01.280
For example you apply this Haast profile to our new I host.

05:01.420 --> 05:05.880
And one day you make a small change in the host provide when you check compliance.

05:05.890 --> 05:12.720
You see all the holes that these Mott's apply to change in its configuration.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.810
So you need to apply the challenge to argue is X a holes just delete this message.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.820
So we go its a host.

05:21.870 --> 05:26.790
We got your host provider and we chose remediate to apply to change.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.130
So let's check before doing that.

05:29.140 --> 05:40.920
So if we go to different service so you see I told Isak's I shit and it is stop if we go to that and

05:41.040 --> 05:48.240
sign same configuration is desirable and does it stop it stop.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.770
And it typically is disabled.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.720
So lets try to apply do Haast profile in this one.

05:54.730 --> 06:05.140
So we chose remediate the head is it it's good to shake the one that we did before to tell you if this

06:05.290 --> 06:09.430
post is undergoing immediate or mot so we can chose this one.

06:09.440 --> 06:15.220
It's the same as we did in the preview.

06:15.470 --> 06:19.130
Then it will give you the state of the hospital fight.

06:19.250 --> 06:24.200
This Isak's I host so ready to remediate.

06:24.200 --> 06:24.790
That's mean.

06:24.910 --> 06:28.130
It's ready to make an immediate head is it the difference.

06:28.160 --> 06:34.900
Change of course when you apply our cost profile you will get about the child that can be happen.

06:35.030 --> 06:38.190
Configure time server to be this IP.

06:38.440 --> 06:47.490
Starting the start up policy for service S M to on sitting to startup policy for service S M S S H.

06:47.580 --> 06:52.950
On setting the startup policy for service in the PD you aren't.

06:53.020 --> 06:58.230
This is the divide that will be applied to do new House of course in the right environment you will

06:58.230 --> 07:01.300
have more detailed iterum this is just an example.

07:01.470 --> 07:04.520
Then reboot Hall's wish rock y.

07:04.710 --> 07:09.000
Let's see if any of the city and county need to reboot the host to apply.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.150
You check this one.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.620
That's me and will automatically reboot any post.

07:12.630 --> 07:15.030
Of course it will put it in dimensionless mode.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.830
It will migrate the difference between machine to another host.

07:18.910 --> 07:24.760
Then reboot this hoss and immigrates do a virtual machine to this review Hulst.

07:24.990 --> 07:27.490
So check this one.

07:27.490 --> 07:33.620
Some Hulst might require reboot to complete a remediation process if you wish to manually reboot tossed

07:34.060 --> 07:35.500
and or the process.

07:35.740 --> 07:37.210
The check box.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.790
Of course we leave it like that.

07:38.800 --> 07:47.530
Then we click Finish and remember the last option will be to enable and do other service will be changed

07:47.590 --> 07:48.430
to enable

07:53.730 --> 07:55.510
it to stay right there.

07:55.800 --> 08:06.000
There are host configuration change applied Buche apply whilst on the Grecian brushless me and our list

08:06.030 --> 08:11.460
of configuration will be applied to the host's configuration.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.060
So how does it.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.530
It's complete successfully.

08:14.730 --> 08:19.740
So no it you see it's become run it and become enabled.

08:19.850 --> 08:24.370
If we click on it you will see the detailed IP address become one.

08:24.380 --> 08:29.420
11 If you remember it's become running manually to use.

08:29.420 --> 08:32.300
Network time the entropy.

08:32.540 --> 08:42.690
Then we walk to the security profile and we check the swan they'll recreation and will be charged.

08:42.700 --> 08:47.820
Here is year 6 I shall become running the S S H is running.

08:48.020 --> 08:52.270
So we make do the change by using the hosts profile.

08:52.310 --> 08:53.280
We checked it x.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.540
I read that is not at the St. Regis hospital tonight.

08:56.600 --> 09:01.210
It's still the Aldo's service but we didn't change.

09:01.220 --> 09:04.310
Still disabled like you see right there.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.690
The E6 I share.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.370
And s h is.

09:07.430 --> 09:08.230
Stop it.

09:08.450 --> 09:11.130
Then of course at that time.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.860
So next we'll try to apply the host profile to it.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.540
I treat so soon the next week.
