00:00.560 --> 00:01.480
Hello again.

00:01.630 --> 00:08.350
So let's try to export a host profile of course after making some it is to export the host's profile

00:08.360 --> 00:09.610
and simply click on that.

00:09.700 --> 00:14.500
You have an option to host profile and you have extract highest profile.

00:14.590 --> 00:19.860
Of course this the second one it will not available if you don't have any host profile available.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.930
If you have zero profile in the hospital fine tape.

00:24.040 --> 00:29.860
This option will not exist but when we are past a hospital fine.

00:29.970 --> 00:32.970
This host will see the other option will be available.

00:33.160 --> 00:39.820
So before that let's make some change in due course so we can have different configuration between.

00:39.820 --> 00:44.410
This is because I host and the other is my host to see the difference.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.090
So for example let's go to

00:48.920 --> 00:53.520
option return but it won't be in into tight configuration.

00:53.540 --> 00:59.530
We try to change the time configuration from manually to use network protocol.

00:59.750 --> 01:06.300
Then we chose for example start and stop but we host the pet store.

01:06.830 --> 01:14.780
And of course we need to get our piece of the A.P. For example let's use our rock.

01:14.870 --> 01:19.670
It's not available in my system but we just put it on a test.

01:19.670 --> 01:22.600
So we changed start and stop with the hosts.

01:22.610 --> 01:28.860
We enable the A.P. service and we add the A.P. server so we click OK.

01:29.060 --> 01:32.910
So we have our change in the time.

01:34.290 --> 01:38.250
Then for example we try to make another change.

01:39.190 --> 01:48.550
To see an example then let's try a security profile and try to enable some surveys.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.200
Check the content.

01:50.210 --> 01:56.280
For example the fire or if you want to change the firewall option we talk a little about this one into

01:56.330 --> 01:57.340
preview.

01:57.560 --> 02:02.840
You can enable and disable any ports in your E-6 host.

02:03.200 --> 02:12.860
Then we have the of be sites where we have the E6 ice share and the option is stop it lets try to enable

02:12.860 --> 02:21.590
them to go to the E6 I ship and chose foreign on stop with the host.

02:21.590 --> 02:22.760
We click start.

02:22.930 --> 02:26.610
Thats when we enable Isak's I shan't and Esch.

02:26.830 --> 02:32.980
So we click on the date by which shows start and stop with the host of course if we leave start and

02:32.980 --> 02:34.860
stop manually and click start.

02:35.010 --> 02:37.760
When we able to do it because the host will change it.

02:37.870 --> 02:40.620
Stop because its need to start again.

02:40.780 --> 02:48.410
But when we chose to stop with the host every time we went to reboot the host will enable its edge.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.680
So we click Start What is it it's running.

02:51.920 --> 03:02.120
OK so we have no time configuration sieging and E-6 i.e. shit is running and S S H is running.

03:02.290 --> 03:08.960
If we checked the other is X I host the E-6 ice shell and it is not running.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.730
You see this one is stop.

03:11.020 --> 03:16.230
And the same for E-6 I number three.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.520
So not we have some difference between.

03:18.530 --> 03:22.780
The difference is host and Dujuan that we make a default configuration.

03:22.780 --> 03:25.400
This is just an example you get the idea.

03:25.510 --> 03:29.800
For example you have are sitting in this host.

03:29.860 --> 03:38.270
You dont need to repeat them I three four five six assembly export the hospital file and then attachÃ©s

03:38.290 --> 03:41.460
The difference is a play host to that host profile.

03:41.650 --> 03:49.470
So we click on Nates which shows host profile extractor hosts profile so host profile would give us

03:49.490 --> 03:54.880
for example name based on feek from Essex.

03:54.970 --> 03:59.430
I one just know that this is the county from the try one.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.480
This is the best config.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.930
Do you use x.

04:07.230 --> 04:16.930
In my data center like that any future know that this is the contents of that host profile.

04:17.190 --> 04:24.990
Makes little about quick overview finish and we'll have our hosts profile available.

04:26.380 --> 04:33.160
So when we create the host profile available we can go to the ethics.

04:33.150 --> 04:40.120
I hope that we will want to see that the stitching of its Droguet the hosts provide and we click on

04:40.120 --> 04:45.450
Nates we chose from displays upis should host profile.

04:45.490 --> 04:48.620
The second option is Attash Holst's profile.

04:48.850 --> 04:53.570
So next we'll see how to attach a hospital file and what can happen in the next.
