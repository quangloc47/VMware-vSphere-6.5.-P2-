00:01.330 --> 00:02.090
Blogging.

00:02.240 --> 00:06.780
So let's try to apply the hospital five to six.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.940
I number three with another step.

00:09.980 --> 00:11.670
So we got to the house to provide.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.410
We got to do this.

00:13.490 --> 00:14.840
Right.

00:15.440 --> 00:23.850
Then of course you check it out that we have one last warning state of this warning.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.490
You've got to do is I hope.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.470
Of course they just need to rephrase to delete this one.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.290
E6 I shed for the host has enabled it.

00:37.330 --> 00:45.470
If you remember this exclamation mark show that we have it is H and shell enable it in this host.

00:45.490 --> 00:46.850
So it's not our problem.

00:46.930 --> 00:50.310
So it's buck.

00:50.370 --> 00:56.910
So I got the message is only about his age and the shell in Niblett.

00:57.200 --> 01:05.370
That's the only problem connected to the host exist in the cluster and spews out and more about the

01:05.670 --> 01:10.210
cost then uptime is about ninety eight minutes.

01:10.250 --> 01:19.910
So we want to add another hostes we can simply go right ahead and up ushe Attash hosts then we add the

01:19.930 --> 01:22.760
different tones that is excised to each other exist.

01:22.850 --> 01:31.460
If we chose E-6 I want and I like that when we click Finish next.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.690
So it's obscure for the customization.

01:33.740 --> 01:40.620
So I think there are not cost to musicians sitting because this host's profile have only some stink

01:40.650 --> 01:45.620
about the service so it's not having any conflict.

01:46.170 --> 01:51.270
So you see the like connected normal connected connected.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.600
That's it there are all the information about them.

01:54.790 --> 02:02.220
Then if we back to the Somali head to change through one complaint I took that apply to stitching to

02:02.330 --> 02:02.630
inc.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.610
No that's me.

02:03.670 --> 02:06.120
It does not know anything about the store.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.100
The new E-6 I host then zero no compliant.

02:10.170 --> 02:16.360
So we go to check do compliance between this hospital and a different E6 I host.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.570
So we export from Isak's I want.

02:19.590 --> 02:24.130
So if I weren't already compliant with this hostes profile.

02:24.150 --> 02:31.230
So we should see number two right here is X I do and I want LRAD compliance.

02:31.670 --> 02:35.420
Then we have only do it because I trust that is not compliance.

02:35.490 --> 02:40.790
It should Chandru one and two right hand.

02:40.870 --> 02:45.380
So check compliance is what I want E6 I do and it is I.

02:45.670 --> 02:49.280
Of course we need to refresh your get the update.

02:49.450 --> 02:57.040
So you know we have two compliance and one in compliance no compliance.

02:57.080 --> 03:03.610
See if we take return we see the different E6 host then the compliance and not compliance.
