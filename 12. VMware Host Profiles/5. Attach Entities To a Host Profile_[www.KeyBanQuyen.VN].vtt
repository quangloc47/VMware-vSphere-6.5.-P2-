WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:02.650
Then we have another option right here.

00:02.770 --> 00:08.850
Chick Haast profile compliance of associated entity if we click on it it shows your a note on the site

00:08.850 --> 00:12.670
because he does not have any hosts attached to this host's profile.

00:12.930 --> 00:19.950
Then we have attachÃ©s a host profile to a halt and then we click on that you are partial to a different

00:20.030 --> 00:20.880
house we have.

00:21.060 --> 00:28.620
So for example we want to use this hospital provide in our our host so we click on this option then

00:28.620 --> 00:34.590
we select the cluster we can add the default cluster that's mean we want to apply the stitching to the

00:34.590 --> 00:41.100
far E6 I also into a cluster or we can pick up the ones that we want for example E-6 einem but we look

00:41.100 --> 00:45.880
at our Should is X I number two other is X I number four number five.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.110
Tell all you can.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.620
Our default cluster like this one.

00:49.680 --> 00:55.620
Then of course if you have another cluster and so on and so on what you want to delete someone you click

00:56.300 --> 01:00.390
detach and Attash or you can choose this option.

01:00.450 --> 01:03.950
Attash and detached are of each house.

01:04.050 --> 01:10.470
So for example we click Next it will the check.

01:10.470 --> 01:17.180
The difference is I Holst's And of course it will give you our customized Haast.

01:17.490 --> 01:25.170
That's me when we try to attach this Haast profile we exported and it is I number one one of the data

01:25.200 --> 01:27.120
that we have in that is x.

01:27.270 --> 01:34.900
Number one is if the others do ID and some other information that should not be the same in another

01:34.910 --> 01:35.700
house.

01:35.970 --> 01:42.470
One of the rules that you should know that you can't apply for stitching exported from is X I host number

01:42.470 --> 01:49.890
one to another E6 I host non-battle will give you a colorfully if you remember when we clone our virtual

01:49.890 --> 01:58.080
machine to complete we create our specification file you get to do a specific configuration for another

01:58.080 --> 01:59.070
virtual machine.

01:59.160 --> 02:07.520
And also we chose that Droguet the deployment of new virtual machine from a template with our deployment.

02:07.560 --> 02:17.540
Ask administrators to give our hostname our system name for the machine also give our address and generates

02:17.550 --> 02:23.470
on your ES ID and so on and so on some information should not be duplicated.

02:23.880 --> 02:29.730
And if for example in this example we should not duplicate the address or we will have our conflicts

02:29.790 --> 02:31.010
in our network.

02:31.140 --> 02:37.830
We should most duplicate the MAC address also which will not duplicate the ID of the host and so on

02:37.860 --> 02:38.540
and so on.

02:38.730 --> 02:46.510
So in the real environment we can't attach the first meeting of a hospital fight in a modern host profile.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.570
This is our wrong step.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.530
So here is give you the details that should not be changed.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.760
For example this is the address of the host.

02:55.770 --> 03:05.750
If you take this one for example the host of E-6 I number one the are on formation.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.830
For example this name should be in a tree.

03:08.850 --> 03:18.950
If we leave this one ours in the hospital if I have the name is X I won and this this is it is a number

03:19.230 --> 03:25.890
we should not change the name of the horse in the MAC address and so on and so on all this information

03:26.190 --> 03:28.840
should not be changed.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.480
So this is a surmise.

03:30.510 --> 03:35.970
Let me ask you to customizes confirmation because it is illogical to use the same information.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.270
So when we click Finish it will appreciate this one.

03:39.280 --> 03:44.310
But to avoid any mistake and destroy my love I will consider this one.

03:44.310 --> 03:47.920
But of course you can complete this process by click Finish.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.430
So just do it in a safe place to avoid damaging my house and I need to rebuild the file Haast from the

03:56.430 --> 03:58.110
beginning.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.130
So this is a different option we have.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.230
Also we have some other option right.

04:02.270 --> 04:02.760
Check.

04:02.860 --> 04:06.600
Hospital fire compliance is deceived as one attache.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.700
It has this option that we see Copi ceasing from horoscope is hitting too hard.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.130
Duplicate export and it is sitting.

04:15.140 --> 04:16.850
Then rename the deletes.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.030
So next we'll see.

04:18.130 --> 04:21.740
It is searching to discover more about the host profile.

04:21.840 --> 04:22.650
So don't be.
