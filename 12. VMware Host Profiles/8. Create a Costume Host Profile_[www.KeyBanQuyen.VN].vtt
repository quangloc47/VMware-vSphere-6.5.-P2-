00:01.660 --> 00:02.460
Blogging.

00:02.980 --> 00:09.760
So when we try to Attash our house profile to a specific cause of course in real environment we should

00:09.760 --> 00:18.040
go to the hospital fight right here and Attash I'll do cluster or all the different hosts in one time

00:18.070 --> 00:19.500
to provide.

00:19.630 --> 00:26.320
But just to get the idea I was going to do it one by one but in a room you can't do step one by one

00:26.620 --> 00:28.430
because it will take a lot of time.

00:28.540 --> 00:31.980
So we got to do a host and we got to provide.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.180
And no we chose Attash Post profile.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.460
So it will show you all the different hosts profile available.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.590
We chose the one that we want.

00:41.890 --> 00:47.600
Then skip hospitalization check this one you might need to customize the house later.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.310
So we want to customize the host's right now.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.430
Then next

00:55.770 --> 01:01.440
then it's good to have the customization configuration that necessary to audits.

01:01.470 --> 01:09.300
So if you remember it Padre's demarc eyes cause the unit to add a configuration so no we have the MAC

01:09.300 --> 01:11.430
address is empty you need to add one.

01:11.430 --> 01:18.260
The IP address etc. you need to add them one by one to have weight that conferee.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.430
That's of course we're not going to do this step.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.520
Let's go to the e6.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.180
I host do provide.

01:26.280 --> 01:33.480
And what do you see then we have the highest profile this customization specification for the virtual

01:33.480 --> 01:39.180
machine we talk about in the preview calls and create some Noko summarization fight for Windows and

01:39.180 --> 01:40.350
Linux machine.

01:40.370 --> 01:47.450
Now we've got to the hospital fight and we gotta do this config of the hosts profile.

01:47.820 --> 01:54.770
So how do you see the default about to do this config from E6 I want the hosts profile looking what

01:55.080 --> 01:57.230
you see best configured the name.

01:57.250 --> 02:07.410
This is the description they created on last modification and non-compliant 0 0 compliant 0 then summary

02:07.440 --> 02:13.270
about the configuration domain that cost it's one in the network configuration.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.300
It's just a quick information about this hospital right.

02:17.290 --> 02:24.210
They are monitored to check any issue or task the compliance if you have any compliance error them then

02:24.330 --> 02:31.850
the configuration of course you can it is the configuration of this host provide disks that we saw when

02:31.860 --> 02:33.770
we did the hospital fight.

02:33.900 --> 02:40.680
So we took any attack and you can make it it's in and the house attaches to this post profile.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.870
So what we're going to do will try to avoid that customization.

02:47.050 --> 02:50.500
Step customize the IP address and so on.

02:50.510 --> 02:58.330
So we got it sitting and we tried to get only the seating that we want to apply to different tasks.

02:58.490 --> 03:02.070
In my situation we have the data on time.

03:02.070 --> 03:04.950
If we make a change but on time.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.010
So I would chose a date like that.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.090
So at the end we have that option.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.200
How does it do that and time.

03:13.430 --> 03:20.700
So if you remember we appear it before the rest of the A.P. we chose to be remember with pretty automatic

03:20.700 --> 03:23.960
little connect to the A.P. server.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.500
So this is the thing that we did.

03:25.520 --> 03:34.430
So no we want to apply the configuration of the original setting that on time and hot date time configuration.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.150
So let's create our not break.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.290
And we chose the different option that we want.

03:41.300 --> 03:54.970
For example date and time exist in G all sistem 16.

03:58.420 --> 04:03.920
Then we have the other Awam that's clearly what we would do.

04:03.950 --> 04:05.570
This is H.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.230
Remember we talk about it how does it do it.

04:12.090 --> 04:19.780
H it is it the one that we want and S H.

04:21.440 --> 04:29.800
Exist in the serious Feig and into serious coffee again.

04:32.460 --> 04:41.510
Also we have end t be the option response from the stop and then start the service with the host start

04:41.820 --> 04:48.270
service now and configure it to start and stop the hosts or start automatically if any part are open

04:48.300 --> 04:50.300
or start on stock money.

04:50.340 --> 04:53.250
So we have far and stop now.

04:53.250 --> 05:00.440
So we need this service to export it to the different Trost because we change the setting of the from

05:00.560 --> 05:03.240
money really to connect automatically.

05:03.240 --> 05:08.970
So in the BT exist in the service coffee

05:11.830 --> 05:14.740
then you have the shell option.

05:15.650 --> 05:16.530
Yes.

05:16.970 --> 05:20.780
This is the one that I saw for the shell.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.620
If you check this one this is the name of do Isak's I said.

05:25.730 --> 05:28.430
And this one is etch.

05:29.030 --> 05:34.620
So we have this one start to sit on it to start and stop with the host.

05:34.630 --> 05:41.240
You remember we Changi Tristan stop with the host and this one start the series and I think to start

05:41.420 --> 05:42.670
and stop the.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.400
So these two options that we want so we get this one right here.

05:48.260 --> 05:55.570
Like that's this one is shared and the preview one for is etch.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.410
So this is the different services that we want to export.

05:59.560 --> 06:06.290
So we simply close this one sort I mean Mikami stick discussed this one.

06:06.290 --> 06:08.190
Then we eat it sitting.

06:08.270 --> 06:12.200
And we try to only check do what we want.

06:12.410 --> 06:19.830
So for example Next let's start with the first one but and that exist in our city.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.400
So the general seating.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.510
We click on this.

06:23.510 --> 06:28.100
Of course we need to check this one and check only the one that we want.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.420
What is it.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.610
It Up system 16.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.260
We have that time.

06:37.280 --> 06:43.180
So click on this one and this one automatically Chicot so that our time is OK.

06:43.190 --> 06:51.890
Then we have the t s m s h exist in service coffee service config because this one we go to a network

06:51.890 --> 06:55.780
we don't need any think about network security.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.760
And is close.

06:58.870 --> 07:01.670
This one way and check out the option.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.160
Then we got to security and the city

07:07.420 --> 07:09.230
or into service call fee.

07:09.490 --> 07:15.910
Then we have serious conflict and there we have the D S M and M S H.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.600
So we Chiquitos to one that we want to export.

07:19.850 --> 07:23.230
Then we have inti deeply into service config.

07:24.860 --> 07:31.060
And the DP service config that is in ration about the time zone.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.220
So we in cheek are other things that we want.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.060
For example this one we don't need to export any Stoneheart population.

07:38.060 --> 07:42.060
Also we don't export any other wants of coffee sitting.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.530
So we do want those who want to click Finish.

07:45.600 --> 07:51.100
No we enable only those options that we want to use in our environment.

07:52.010 --> 07:57.590
Of course if you have any firewall work on you can check the firewall configuration if you want to export

07:57.710 --> 08:03.260
but to apply the power system configuration to argue it is because I host you cheek the one and so on

08:03.350 --> 08:05.230
and so on.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.990
So next we'll try to connect our is Clay has this profile.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.760
So you don't expect.
