00:00.570 --> 00:04.390
So when we click on the highest profile we have some new option updates.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.660
Of course this one is extract.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.800
This one is to import from your laptop.

00:09.970 --> 00:14.330
Then Salmaniya auction integration about do cost profile.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.960
So the one that we have had duplicate hosts profile.

00:18.090 --> 00:22.040
That's when you have a host providing you can't duplicate it to another one.

00:22.050 --> 00:25.420
You give it one example name but it's all description.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.550
Next then finish.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.300
That's me.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.040
You want to make a small editing in that host profile and use it in a different I host.

00:34.220 --> 00:40.630
When you have thousands E6 I host you want to make our editing for 50 is a host.

00:40.780 --> 00:46.770
And another model different configuration to the other 50 six host.

00:46.900 --> 00:51.460
So you simply duplicate this one you go to the second one and mix it in.

00:51.510 --> 00:55.180
Then you attach it to the other 50 I host.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.710
So then we have the option right collect copies switching from host.

00:59.710 --> 01:06.210
That's mean you already have a cost and you want to update the host profile you can't copy the switching

01:06.210 --> 01:07.170
from another host.

01:07.170 --> 01:15.090
For example we create switching from E6 I want them we see that is I number two have the right seating

01:15.120 --> 01:16.530
for our environment.

01:16.530 --> 01:21.460
So we simply click on those click OK and we'll get updates from it.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.890
Eyeholes number two then we have copies sitting sitting hosts profile.

01:27.210 --> 01:33.460
This one copy sitting Krumholz this one copy CC to hospital fight.

01:33.550 --> 01:40.230
That's mean you want to export some configuration from this one to the other one or to another one host

01:40.230 --> 01:47.070
provider and then you have three or four highest profile then you want to export some special switching

01:47.070 --> 01:49.310
from this host to the other hosts.

01:49.350 --> 01:57.080
So we click on this one and then copy sitting there it'll give you to different city we have in the

01:57.090 --> 01:57.890
hospital fine.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.430
So if you remember this is the difference you think we have in a hospital fight.

02:01.650 --> 02:05.030
So to just go quickly and then we're back to talk about it.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.600
So for example we want to export the sitting of a network.

02:09.600 --> 02:16.060
For example this has to have the right network configuration the profile of the different configuration

02:16.080 --> 02:24.240
that we need except do a network seating that's cancel this one you have for example the host profile.

02:24.330 --> 02:27.730
Number one we do good sitting in your environment.

02:27.880 --> 02:33.800
Then as you are a manager you try to get another optimized seating of the network in your environment

02:34.130 --> 02:34.750
you.

02:34.810 --> 02:42.080
And I host and use it for the environment for example to mix and with that host.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.310
Then you create our very good network seating in that host.

02:46.310 --> 02:51.560
And you know that's the New York City will be very good on our other hosts.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.900
So you simply expose the profile of that hosts.

02:55.920 --> 03:02.790
But of course that not only have the network's seating does not have the star seating system seating

03:02.850 --> 03:03.920
all the other seating.

03:04.050 --> 03:11.640
It's only how do network seating the best network seating you discover at that moment what you're going

03:11.640 --> 03:20.550
to do is to copy the network teaching and updated in the preview has to have the stars seeing the system

03:20.550 --> 03:24.150
seating etc. you're only up there to do network seating.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.880
So for that you got to the highest profile.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.510
You click on Copi seating to Haast profile.

03:30.720 --> 03:36.660
Of course we need to go to this one that we want is missing from this one to this one and not from this

03:36.660 --> 03:38.150
one to this one.

03:38.220 --> 03:44.760
So we chose the one that we explored to seemed to send Did you do one that with import sitting.

03:44.940 --> 03:49.150
So we are in the highest profile member to the top of good networks.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.580
We click on this button.

03:51.900 --> 03:58.320
We chose the setting to copy to the other hosts provide we chose for those up networks to think because

03:58.320 --> 04:01.190
we have a good network sitting in these halls.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.490
Then we click next.

04:03.720 --> 04:11.010
It's show you all the different hospitals available in your list to import your network seating that

04:11.010 --> 04:14.530
we chose to we have this hosts provide number one.

04:14.550 --> 04:21.810
It's the one that's only available so we click on that then we click next to show you all the details

04:22.160 --> 04:25.890
on what the host profile will get on updates about the stitching.

04:25.980 --> 04:31.030
That's kind of network seating Lavis which is which leg configuration et cetera.

04:31.230 --> 04:37.260
So all the information about the network will be exported the scuzzy IP address etc..

04:38.670 --> 04:46.400
Then finish and will updates from the hospital 5 to 2 hosts a profile one.

04:46.680 --> 04:53.890
So it's bus successfully that has its capacity to host profile from host profile to to host profile.

04:53.910 --> 04:54.180
What.
