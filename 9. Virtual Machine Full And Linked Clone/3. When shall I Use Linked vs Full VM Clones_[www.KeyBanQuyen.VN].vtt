00:00.330 --> 00:07.560
So what of the question that I can put in your mind why we need to use the following learn and not just

00:07.560 --> 00:13.370
use the first provision to make a quick clone and all the tank will work perfectly.

00:13.710 --> 00:17.510
So the situation here is not as you think.

00:17.640 --> 00:26.130
If you remember in the snapshot we say that it is high on the do not leave us not more than 13 days.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.600
So in this region we use a snapshot the virtual machine work in a snapshot mode.

00:31.620 --> 00:36.140
In our original disk so the snapshot will start consuming more size.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.180
This not short will cost me more size.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.490
So we have more space consuming.

00:40.560 --> 00:48.570
But in this situation is not a problem of space but it will a problem of the performance of the virtual

00:48.570 --> 00:49.630
machine.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.870
So imagine if we create only one.

00:51.870 --> 00:52.880
It's not a problem.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.690
But imagine if you create 10 virtual machine using do linkit clone.

00:57.780 --> 01:04.270
We have 10 virtual machine with a built out this all of them connected to the same original disk.

01:04.290 --> 01:08.550
This original disk will have an overloading from a different it's a video machine.

01:08.550 --> 01:15.440
When you have a lot of your machine and use that to start making some rights and read from disk the

01:15.470 --> 01:22.200
disk can't support all the virtual machine so the disk will start in the virtual machine would start

01:22.290 --> 01:25.420
freezing and some problem would be start happening.

01:25.650 --> 01:32.220
And the situation if something wrong happened to the original disk but it was up with this disk crashed

01:32.280 --> 01:41.060
or the data deleted with another disk or anything else on the virtual machine connected to this.

01:41.070 --> 01:48.450
This will be out of service so your last five or 10 virtual machine at the same time.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.920
But in this situation if the virtual machine a have a problem in the disk and this machine out of service

01:56.280 --> 02:03.510
the virtual machine still work perfectly head to victory the machine a second or a third or a fourth.

02:03.630 --> 02:08.350
Well out of service at the same time we do virtual machine.

02:08.760 --> 02:15.360
So this is do but think about the first provision but in some times we need to use it in a specific

02:15.600 --> 02:16.200
situation.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.160
For example we have some temporary use.

02:18.410 --> 02:21.570
What a new employer come to your company.

02:21.570 --> 02:27.540
Want to make some work for a specific reason in your company he will work in your company for example

02:27.540 --> 02:29.700
for 13 days then he will go.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.270
You don't need to create a full complete virtual machine.

02:32.310 --> 02:37.440
You simply do a first provision are linked into one of your virtual machine.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.910
You give it to use it to work on this.

02:39.930 --> 02:46.590
Then when he finish his work you do your one and keep the original one and so on and so on.

02:46.670 --> 02:53.460
Another situation you have some thumper or user or different users who want to use only Windows 7 for

02:53.460 --> 02:54.960
example or windows.

02:54.970 --> 03:02.530
Then you make this link get the clone and work with it in a specific situation.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.830
So this is the idea of the first provision.
