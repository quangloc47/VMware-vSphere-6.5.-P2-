00:00.250 --> 00:06.830
What's the new one that's got it get Clooney or the first provision we glue on our virtual machine in

00:06.840 --> 00:07.840
a small time.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.050
And it's happened faster.

00:10.380 --> 00:14.380
How do fast provision or linkit Cronyn work.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.420
We have the virtual machine.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.940
This one.

00:18.070 --> 00:23.400
IBM dequeue file for example is being decie consume three or four terabytes.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.800
In this situation we can't make up Falconi it will take a lot of time but of course in your situation

00:28.830 --> 00:35.460
if you need a Falconi you need to do it and give it all the time necessary to complete the process.

00:35.700 --> 00:42.720
But in a specific situation you need a virtual machine for example a temporary type or simple service

00:42.770 --> 00:43.420
etc..

00:43.590 --> 00:47.530
You can do our first provision cloning.

00:47.970 --> 00:51.650
So what's happened in the provision cloning or linkit cloning.

00:51.780 --> 01:00.660
So we have to hear a machine a tab on a hard disk or better yet hard disk that used the data on say

01:00.810 --> 01:07.580
write and read from the disk when we run ah link it.

01:07.580 --> 01:08.990
Clooney what's happened.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.430
No the VM what we're going to create our Snapshot to this virtual machine.

01:14.460 --> 01:20.820
And that's why we didn't cover link it cloning in the preview cost because we didn't cover the snapshots.

01:20.850 --> 01:27.680
So know when we covered the snapshot when we ran a link it cannot It's create a snapshot virtual machine

01:29.160 --> 01:33.440
the first snapshot that's created it creates our pipeline if you will.

01:33.540 --> 01:40.310
But they'll fight the Stigand VM decie that will save ancient Chopan from this military machine.

01:40.490 --> 01:47.160
But I mean this virtual machine will start using the original disk for read only and the second that

01:47.260 --> 01:48.950
is for read.

01:49.020 --> 01:49.950
Right.

01:50.010 --> 02:00.630
So the virtual machine start using the original disk for read only and use the new disk for read and

02:00.630 --> 02:09.500
write any updates happened to disabuse because machine will be sorted into desktop and disk then do.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.600
VM what will Clun do.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.230
Does this work.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.440
But of course it will be a numpty.

02:15.480 --> 02:21.950
They'll see this because when we make Deukalion in Hickory the snapshot for this victory and machine

02:21.950 --> 02:29.450
that's main phrase this disk and do this for the read only and creates an empty disk and into some tape

02:29.510 --> 02:37.920
will clone this data disk to a new data disk that would be using for our modern virtual machine.

02:37.920 --> 02:45.520
So in this situation we have to the disk and one original disk so the disk is similar to this one.

02:45.520 --> 02:53.070
The same situation in the US does this that virtual machine connect to do this to see if any change

02:53.440 --> 02:56.540
and connect to the original disk for read only.

02:56.760 --> 03:04.290
And the new virtual machine let's call it a SIGINT or a comma will connect to the new Delta disk for

03:04.320 --> 03:05.210
any change.

03:05.250 --> 03:10.800
As right on the right and connected original disk for read only.

03:10.830 --> 03:17.100
So in this situation with this but there's lots of only two or five megabytes it would be a first copy

03:17.160 --> 03:24.910
of this deal that this new discovery that this spawning it will have a new data as quick as possible

03:25.370 --> 03:32.370
and a virtual machine a and b say couldn't connect to the same origin or disk and sort of to change

03:32.370 --> 03:35.300
Ã¡n separates bodies into VM.

03:35.370 --> 03:42.540
A second will save the chance in this deal to disk and save the change in this deal.

03:42.600 --> 03:42.840
This.
