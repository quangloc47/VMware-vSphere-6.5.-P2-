WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.070
Help again.

00:02.190 --> 00:05.860
So the link it galloon that we talk about.

00:06.060 --> 00:14.190
Unfortunately you can't create art linkit clone from the center the center server does not have this

00:14.250 --> 00:17.450
option to clone machine.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.580
Ours are linkit clone.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.100
This option is only available when you.

00:22.300 --> 00:29.850
We ate the virtual desktop ox's this Droon lets you to create our linkit.

00:30.150 --> 00:34.550
And as you know the link it clone use it for appropriate service.

00:34.740 --> 00:38.760
That's why this option is not available in our decentest ever.

00:38.820 --> 00:45.970
So if we check the software that's created by our video a virtual desktop access.

00:46.130 --> 00:54.440
When you try to clone a virtual machine you have the file clone and do link it cannot so alink clone

00:54.470 --> 00:59.930
is a reference to the original virtual machine and require less disk space to store.

00:59.930 --> 01:04.060
However it cannot run without access to the original virtual machine.

01:04.400 --> 01:11.570
So this is why the visitor center would not let you to create a link it grown in your rent environment

01:11.600 --> 01:16.090
because this is not safe in our real environment.

01:16.610 --> 01:23.280
So another information that we have for the glory that's mean we clone a virtual machine.

01:23.390 --> 01:30.170
But in a situation that we have some specific machine in a service use it in our that's mean we have

01:30.170 --> 01:36.260
a database connected to do our shared brain and another machine connected to do shit it Queen etc..

01:36.380 --> 01:42.080
We put them inside of we up with a specific order of power on our shadow.

01:42.230 --> 01:48.500
No we can't clone all the virtual machine that's worked on inside our ark.

01:48.860 --> 01:53.230
So if we click on the app we have the option Kalid clone.

01:53.300 --> 02:00.200
Of course this option will be available only if all the virtual machine part of any virtual machine

02:00.260 --> 02:05.380
parted on the Cloonan is not available because you will go into more than one virtual machine.

02:05.390 --> 02:11.260
You'd be five maybe six maybe 10 virtual machine at the same time and that's need more time.

02:11.270 --> 02:16.920
So the Wii and were decided to not divvy up the top about it on your machine.

02:17.090 --> 02:20.450
So simply click on the Wii V-Amp we have option.

02:20.630 --> 02:22.590
So we have Kenaan.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.810
And here we have it on your Wii up or on an existing.

02:26.830 --> 02:32.350
The app is the same when you try to create a new Wii up is ask you to create a new one or clone from

02:32.350 --> 02:33.520
an existing one.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.810
So automatically select cloning next.

02:37.910 --> 02:40.930
Then ask you to chose to cluster.

02:40.940 --> 02:44.880
So of course you can choose any X i.e. host Dreamhouse this.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.900
The app that's me in the virtual machine will be cloning in a specific host or you simply chose the

02:49.900 --> 02:54.480
cluster and we'll decide which one can host a virtual machine.

02:54.490 --> 03:03.790
So next then you give it our name for example clone of the app see then we chose the data center next

03:05.790 --> 03:11.540
so for example if you have a moderate center that you want to run the same application as I did you

03:11.550 --> 03:15.290
simply clone this way up through the SIGINT that doesn't.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.160
But in our tradition we have only one.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.270
So it's not a problem.

03:18.270 --> 03:20.600
Next they hear it.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.140
All the data available in different E6 I host I'll do look at that.

03:26.700 --> 03:33.970
Because no we chose the destination Haast is the cluster of us that are available.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.320
So all the available hosts can support this.

03:37.380 --> 03:40.750
And so added that our store is available if we chose for example.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.260
Number two I will show only the datastore number two.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.220
But no he showed them all together.

03:46.230 --> 03:53.100
Of course he had to chose one or two or any land that you had or you simply leave that store cluster

03:53.430 --> 03:54.200
chose do.

03:54.250 --> 03:54.800
Right.

03:54.810 --> 04:04.090
One day we have next had it show you some information about the Octa configuration of the resource of

04:04.090 --> 04:10.690
the Wii up for example you want to change this Cronyn from normal to low for example.

04:10.890 --> 04:15.500
Then make some reservation etc. called off our mission.

04:15.740 --> 04:23.450
In the resource pool and the up would be for then next then head is it we click Finish and we'll clone

04:23.890 --> 04:25.320
due to victory machine.

04:25.340 --> 04:31.790
Of course this process will take a long time because Windows XP have an operating system and the other

04:32.240 --> 04:35.090
machine also have our systems.

04:35.090 --> 04:42.420
If we click on this it will show you the device on Windows XP on host it excites you in Morocco true

04:42.820 --> 04:51.560
in XP for in host E6 I treat so he district which is not virtual machine is exciting and but treat create

04:51.580 --> 04:58.970
a resource pool clone of the upsy in computer resource cluster in Morrocco so it will take a little

04:58.970 --> 05:02.200
time to complete the process one to process it.

05:02.580 --> 05:07.490
So it's a robot that will give you a quick or a view about another option into Qanuni

05:12.110 --> 05:21.120
when we click on one and chose the Santer then the cluster then we have another option right there.

05:21.130 --> 05:28.360
Those Kaulitz other than that if we click on it show you some options you chose some of an easier route

05:28.670 --> 05:30.310
to do in your virtual machine.

05:30.350 --> 05:35.960
So the new vision machine tool config file will be saved in the last number two and the new virtual

05:35.960 --> 05:40.110
machine the hard disk also will be Sumeet in large numbers too.

05:40.190 --> 05:45.170
But if you want for example to make some affinity for example if you have too hard a driver in this

05:45.200 --> 05:51.140
virtual machine that we Cloonan for example have disk number one with ajuga bytes or disk number two.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.180
We did eight or 10 gigabytes.

05:53.180 --> 06:00.390
You can chose to save the disk in number one into London br1 and disk number two in LAN number two for

06:00.530 --> 06:01.940
your tools browser.

06:02.120 --> 06:09.320
Then you chose the cluster or the top Astar or click on this one to chose the line number one example.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.910
It exists in the lump but number two so we change it to number one.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.600
So like lot we put to the config file a lot number one.

06:16.680 --> 06:22.400
And the hard disk in that line but all the hard disk numbers talk in London Buttrick and so on and so

06:22.400 --> 06:23.000
on.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.490
So this is just a quick idea to get information.

06:26.510 --> 06:32.310
Of course if you want to change it from take that provision etc and of course help with those without

06:32.360 --> 06:37.880
any configuration because this is a config file only Abdula a bit of the hard disk you can't chose.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.840
Thick or thin probably.

06:40.070 --> 06:43.250
So this is the quick overview about this operator.

06:43.610 --> 06:44.840
Then you click next.

06:44.870 --> 06:50.660
And of course you can customize the slide please box with the preview of course to get the detail about

06:50.660 --> 06:57.480
them because you can't change the setting of the IP address name the license.

06:57.500 --> 07:05.090
A lot lot of things you can add them by creating our coffee file that we convert it into Preview costs.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.120
So this is the quick idea about it.

07:07.130 --> 07:12.110
You see a clone of the app completes successfully for the virtual machine.

07:12.110 --> 07:15.950
Windows XP number for the second one will be added.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.610
And so on and so on.

07:17.960 --> 07:21.380
So see the next section with another future of the VM with.
