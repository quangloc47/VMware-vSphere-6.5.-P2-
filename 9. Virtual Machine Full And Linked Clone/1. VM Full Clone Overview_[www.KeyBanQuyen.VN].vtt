00:00.870 --> 00:02.350
Hello and welcome again.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.460
So no we're going to discover another future of the VM world.

00:06.650 --> 00:09.330
That's Cullin do cloning.

00:09.330 --> 00:17.370
If you remember from the previous course of the VM where we spend we ever do cloning but we cover a

00:17.370 --> 00:24.780
specific kind of clone that's valid for clone because in the preview calls we didn't call it a snapshot.

00:24.780 --> 00:31.620
So the other future or the other kind of clone that's got that link is cloning is in relation about

00:31.680 --> 00:33.110
two snapshots.

00:33.120 --> 00:38.480
You can't understand the link it can run if you don't know how the snapshot work.

00:38.490 --> 00:45.720
So for that we cover all the information about cloning the config file a different operating system

00:46.100 --> 00:47.030
etc..

00:47.220 --> 00:56.810
And no we're going to recover a little about Falconi and we'll talk about the link good.

00:57.060 --> 00:58.230
So what is do.

00:58.230 --> 01:06.600
VM Kroon if you remember do them clone It's like a peek and post of a virtual machine you have a virtual

01:06.600 --> 01:07.090
machine.

01:07.130 --> 01:13.770
The operating system as started inside is the application necessary etc. and you want to create a virtual

01:13.770 --> 01:20.070
machine with the same operating system with say obligation but you want only to make some small editing

01:20.160 --> 01:23.390
inside it to use it in the service.

01:23.460 --> 01:27.630
In this situation you don't need to create on your virtual machine from the beginner you are studying

01:27.630 --> 01:29.440
the operations at them and so on and so on.

01:29.610 --> 01:37.580
You simply ignore the original Vitry and machine to another virtual machine and make it it in and head

01:37.590 --> 01:42.940
as it's a new virtual machine and ready for use as quick as possible.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.920
In this situation we Khaled's our fall Clun because we could be and both do virtual machine completely

01:50.250 --> 01:54.210
and we create anew separated virtual machine.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.080
So we have to fall clone.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.190
That is the default one.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.970
We have the virtual machine.

02:00.210 --> 02:07.500
We put it into cron task onto this copied new independent virtual machine we create a new virtual machine

02:07.590 --> 02:12.680
that is independent to the virtual machine that's called Virtual Machine.

02:13.160 --> 02:19.610
We cover this auction with fall times about the different kind of colognes different operating system.

02:19.620 --> 02:21.950
For example Windows and Linux machine.

02:22.110 --> 02:28.530
Then we create the config file because when you're on a virtual machine to another one you need to add

02:28.560 --> 02:34.940
our config file for example give it the name of the machine in the operations is them sitting on the

02:34.950 --> 02:42.340
operating system cereal if you want to add on your license to that operation system for example operations

02:42.350 --> 02:44.430
if they use an individual machine.

02:44.450 --> 02:50.040
A have our license for all you on your machine when you clone that operating system you need to add

02:50.070 --> 02:56.580
a new license to do operation system for another virtual machine and so on and so on.

02:57.240 --> 03:06.030
Then we have a manual one that Scarlett linkit on because we have a link relation between the virtual

03:06.030 --> 03:11.400
machine and the original virtual machine that's called first provision.

03:11.400 --> 03:18.270
So the far cloning it's take a lot of time to complete the process when you run our onto our virtual

03:18.270 --> 03:21.560
machine that have 1 gigabytes of data.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.080
It will take time to copy and paste.

03:24.170 --> 03:29.710
That's one gigabyte in another space of to look on or shared.

03:30.390 --> 03:38.250
If you have our machine with one terabytes that will be a big time of Cloonan it will take about four

03:38.280 --> 03:45.390
or five hours to the virtual machine with one bite off the data use it and so on and so on.
