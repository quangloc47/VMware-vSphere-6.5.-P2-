00:01.670 --> 00:03.050
Hello and welcome again.

00:03.230 --> 00:08.370
So let's try our clone of our virtual machine.

00:08.370 --> 00:14.710
We'll try to clone the default one do Falcon all of our machine then we'll see our link.

00:14.710 --> 00:15.400
It cannot.

00:15.600 --> 00:23.030
So for those Aietes you do that if our virtual machine have one terabytes and try to clone this virtual

00:23.030 --> 00:23.400
machine.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.410
It will take time to have four or five how to clone this one.

00:27.410 --> 00:32.840
It's in vision about the speed of the heart over and the network and so on and so on.

00:33.150 --> 00:39.640
So in this situation I will try to make it known in our numpty virtual machine.

00:39.690 --> 00:44.420
So the Windows 7 Number two it's a pity there there's not have any operating system.

00:44.460 --> 00:48.270
So of course it's consume only a small space or the storage.

00:48.270 --> 00:50.660
It's about 300 megabytes.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.590
So the Crewdson will be a little fast in this situation so we can follow due process.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.900
But of course if you do it in for example this one when center it will take time to complete this process.

01:03.970 --> 01:09.680
And we don't need to wait all the time just to get the idea about cloning.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.920
So for example does one consume 27 gigabytes if I try to copy and past this one it will take about one

01:16.920 --> 01:19.080
hour because it's happened.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.630
Truglio network for example when you clone a virtual machine from what I want and do new one you put

01:24.630 --> 01:28.800
it into is X I do mean you copy and paste the data from E6.

01:28.800 --> 01:36.320
I want to E-6 ITL Also if it is already exist in London and br1 and then you can on the new one in LA.

01:36.330 --> 01:41.600
Number two it will take time to copy and past from LA want to land to.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.390
It is information about network speed.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.110
So for those We're going to do it in Windows 7.

01:48.130 --> 01:53.580
Number two that is empty virtual machine to make it as quick as possible.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.390
Also do cloning you can't do anything about it on your machine.

01:58.470 --> 02:03.010
A Life virtual machine all in our power of virtual machine.

02:03.270 --> 02:09.500
So we go to the virtual machine that we want to clone chromate with click on it and we have an option

02:09.520 --> 02:11.270
that's called clone.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.230
We have clamped virtual machine.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.520
We have glued to place to place.

02:16.550 --> 02:22.380
In reality there's option we already send them into preview cards you come back to the preview of course

02:22.410 --> 02:24.860
to watch the section about documenting.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.180
Then on to a virtual machine.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.790
So this option is to file Cloonan.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.620
So we give it a name.

02:31.620 --> 02:44.440
So for example VM when 7 new or for example 0 9 etc. it's in Arisia about byname that you want to give

02:44.440 --> 02:46.450
it for a specific service.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.700
Then you chose the data center.

02:48.730 --> 02:53.540
We only have one of course if you have more details that you can clone a virtual machine from that Santer

02:53.560 --> 02:55.150
want to to true.

02:55.360 --> 03:01.930
Then we click next day and we chose to do cluster because we have a class that returns true neater across

03:01.970 --> 03:02.770
the cluster.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.830
And of course you need to trolls do Haast So the schoolmaster can stewpot this virtual machine.

03:07.830 --> 03:14.560
Of course if you choose cluster it will clone a virtual machine in one of the Isak's available information

03:14.620 --> 03:19.200
about do dearest he will chose do right.

03:19.260 --> 03:25.420
E6 I assert that I can support his virtual machine and this bitter machine inside that Drobe there's

03:25.480 --> 03:32.230
room but of course if you choose to put it into it because I want or E-6 two or three it's the same

03:32.710 --> 03:34.280
you make the choice.

03:34.450 --> 03:39.930
But when you complete the process and run the virtual machine the rest will start a calculation.

03:39.930 --> 03:45.670
The balance between the different is I asked then who would stay true MacGraw is the virtual machine

03:45.670 --> 03:47.200
from E6 I want to.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.520
Know that is excite.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.020
That's constant for this virtual machine.

03:51.280 --> 03:57.350
Of course I didn't know that he will run this virtual machine and is exciting because he is excited

03:57.370 --> 04:00.180
we have more resource and powerful resource.

04:00.460 --> 04:01.600
But if we chose it.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.140
I want you to see that you automatically try to migrate it from it.

04:05.140 --> 04:05.770
I want to.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.230
It's exciting.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.020
So what is chores for example is I want next.

04:11.020 --> 04:16.050
Of course you can choose in it is true that you want to put it inside it if you want to put into resource

04:16.090 --> 04:20.370
pool or just pull 8 inside the resource pool.

04:20.590 --> 04:26.420
The resource pool we do we are all of them have a compatibility check six people.

04:26.650 --> 04:30.670
So they just put it into ESX I host next.

04:30.670 --> 04:34.740
Then you have the option we already covered them before.

04:34.760 --> 04:40.850
Same formats as the datastore default or you your controlled encryption or the V-sign.

04:41.080 --> 04:47.590
Those aren't always recommended to leave them as the default do you need a specific reason to chose

04:47.590 --> 04:49.400
one of those option.

04:49.450 --> 04:55.800
Then we have to chose the data store cluster or do that or store the local store of the Isak's I want

04:56.390 --> 04:58.400
I would have added that I store one.

04:58.570 --> 05:00.750
Or do you choose do that cluster.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.020
But if we want to choose a specific plan we desirable the storage dress for this material machine and

05:08.020 --> 05:10.740
we chose by example Dyllon one or two.

05:10.790 --> 05:15.220
So we want to push this machine to run into one one so we deserved to start there.

05:15.210 --> 05:19.430
As for this machine that's me and this machine will be overwrite.

05:19.670 --> 05:24.500
There is still a there is for the data store cluster.

05:24.610 --> 05:32.200
But if you want to make it to storage rest trolls do right learn the children that this one you simply

05:32.450 --> 05:40.350
chickadees want and tools that I start Ruster automatically chose to write learn or write this to saved

05:40.580 --> 05:43.130
the driver of this virtual machine.

05:43.630 --> 05:48.920
So next then if you remember Alda's option I'd have to customize the operating system.

05:49.060 --> 05:54.460
That's me and you add to license the name the user etc. then do customized with your machine hardware

05:54.460 --> 05:58.450
if you want to add for example drame to do your get your machine.

05:58.450 --> 06:03.490
For example this machine have one gigabytes of hareem you want that you want to not want to give it

06:03.550 --> 06:04.660
to your brain.

06:04.660 --> 06:09.150
You can chose this one to customize it then power on the virtual machine.

06:09.160 --> 06:09.550
That's me.

06:09.580 --> 06:13.550
After cloning this machine will power it on and so on.

06:13.570 --> 06:14.290
And Sol.

06:14.290 --> 06:20.010
So in this situation we cover all those option into preview cards you come back to do a preview course

06:20.020 --> 06:20.790
to check them.

06:21.070 --> 06:25.240
But we'll go forward and click next.

06:25.240 --> 06:32.880
Then a quick overview then he automatically chose a cluster number two by making some calculation.

06:32.890 --> 06:38.080
You see it's an accommodation but of course you can generate more recommendation if you want to get

06:38.080 --> 06:45.440
information about a different recommendation or a column on the rayson satisfy any cel plus Montral

06:45.510 --> 06:46.500
waste.

06:46.510 --> 06:54.360
So I take it that one number one or maybe the London but to learn number two is the one common that

06:54.420 --> 06:56.700
you use this knowledge.

06:56.830 --> 07:01.620
So in any case Uncle coalition and decided that this one will be great too.

07:01.990 --> 07:09.040
But if you want to change it you can click to see don't and chose to start the new virtual machine in

07:09.250 --> 07:11.240
large number two.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.330
So of course we are going to chose the accommodation.

07:13.360 --> 07:18.370
It's not our problem now then finish and that is it applies to the Dennis.

07:18.380 --> 07:33.840
So we chose the stars and didn't stop Kopete us thought of this new machine to do storage available.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.300
So how does it do.

07:35.340 --> 07:40.470
No virtual machine created what has it had is it the end win seven.

07:40.590 --> 07:46.260
Number nine if we check this one you'll find that two stars exist in the land.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.020
Number two is it.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.560
And the new virtual machine is powered up.

07:50.610 --> 07:56.060
You can power on to see that all the data available as the same as this one.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.950
This one does not have any operating system.

07:57.990 --> 08:02.650
So the new one also when not have any open agent system yet.

08:04.930 --> 08:07.700
So how does it win seven number nine.

08:07.780 --> 08:14.710
The operating system is upsy of course in our politics and religion that have no political system we'll

08:14.710 --> 08:17.600
take a lot of time before completing this process.

08:17.620 --> 08:20.350
Also it exists in the house E6 line.

08:20.380 --> 08:26.060
But it took a little time who will try to migrate this but your machine.

08:26.170 --> 08:29.460
So how does it after a moments when I stop recording.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.420
Hey McGeary the virtual machine.

08:31.620 --> 08:39.690
Win 7 2 from a specific cost to Amata in arisen off balance into a resource between the defense.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.960
Also there is great when 7:2 from E6.

08:42.970 --> 08:49.950
I do if you remember we this virtual machine to the Isak's I do mean we have a new machine costumed

08:50.260 --> 08:51.310
resource or the e6.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.890
I saw him agreed.

08:53.050 --> 08:59.520
One of those virtual machine available from Essex to do is X I want in the cluster.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.340
It used the same LAN.

09:01.450 --> 09:09.310
It is not changed a lot but émigrés do Windows 7 2 from A-6 I to do it because I want to get the right

09:09.310 --> 09:15.790
balance so it's up and automatically without doing any Thank you see you in the next video.
