00:02.350 --> 00:12.600
Blogging so after seen the affinity rule of them two of them know we have another kind of affinity is

00:12.600 --> 00:18.650
do these to VM disk affinity in the previous one.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.530
We see the affinity at the level of the host.

00:22.570 --> 00:28.270
No we'll see the affinity of the level of risk of stars.

00:30.280 --> 00:38.270
At the same idea for example we have two virtual machine that's working the same host.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.380
Also the stars should work at the same hosts all in prison.

00:43.550 --> 00:47.460
Do stars of those virtual machines fall into separate Stosh.

00:47.600 --> 00:58.100
If you remember the one of the exchanges server we have a next chance with two case a case 1 and Case

00:58.130 --> 01:02.090
2 that should run on two separate hosts for any reason.

01:02.120 --> 01:08.510
One of the host tickets that the second host will keep working and the exchange server will be available

01:08.510 --> 01:11.530
for the company without any problem.

01:11.600 --> 01:18.830
It must mean that those virtual machines have the storage of the same data store or the same shared

01:18.890 --> 01:19.760
store.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.110
If something wrong happened to do that.

01:23.340 --> 01:28.180
Or just shit it was due to server will be out of service.

01:28.220 --> 01:36.080
So again we lost the connection to the Exchange server for that we need to separate that out store or

01:36.080 --> 01:42.880
separate shedded stores to Aranda difference between a machine that's me and case one should run in

01:42.880 --> 01:46.090
us different server and then do case one.

01:46.090 --> 01:50.780
Also should store the data in different shared storage.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.930
So how do you see the VM to VM.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.230
Antti affinity.

01:55.270 --> 01:59.020
What's I mean don't run vim's on the same got us.

01:59.230 --> 01:59.850
That's me.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.360
This is the usual.

02:01.370 --> 02:08.100
Never ran this virtual machine and virtual machine in the same datastore always separates them two different

02:08.280 --> 02:08.880
stores.

02:09.020 --> 02:15.350
For example this virtual machine will be started in line number one and this second one the virtual

02:15.350 --> 02:21.480
machine or decays on top of the exchange should be started in do LAN talk.

02:22.900 --> 02:29.980
So oh so any reason we have some virtual machine that shows the beat run on the same bus.

02:30.190 --> 02:37.010
I don't know you an example but there are some situations that you would need to run do be on the same

02:37.230 --> 02:37.950
Bastar.

02:38.110 --> 02:47.180
So for that for example Hyde speed of connection between that store one at the top of store to as the

02:47.180 --> 02:52.760
same example for the shared point and the database they should be at the same store to have a speed

02:52.760 --> 02:58.130
connection between rides and rid of this two battery and machine.

02:58.130 --> 03:01.130
So this is do start out there as a group.

03:01.370 --> 03:05.370
That's how the affinity believe it the VM does.

03:05.570 --> 03:12.890
Also we have another kind of Discovery team that is information about to do a hard drive out of the

03:12.890 --> 03:14.130
virtual machine.

03:14.270 --> 03:22.220
So some video machine for example to treat our driver took a look at her driver some database that need

03:22.370 --> 03:30.800
at least three or four look on her driver in Osterberg to work perfectly and do virtual how driver that

03:30.800 --> 03:31.280
we have.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.350
It's got its V.M. decie want to be in decie top when we add another driver to this virtual machine and

03:36.350 --> 03:38.200
will because it's being decie tree.

03:38.330 --> 03:47.420
So we have some rules that we should run VM decie one and VM decie to do same storage and of course

03:47.420 --> 03:53.910
by default every virtual machine created would start all the VM decie in the same stodge.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.510
This is by default root.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.840
And if you check the folder of the virtual machine if you remember that when we browse the folder after

04:02.970 --> 04:08.660
that store LAN number one we see that the name of the virtual machine when we click on it we see different

04:08.800 --> 04:10.410
file of imagery.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.510
And one of them is the VMT key.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.900
If this machine have all hardly ever will seem to want and even decie tool if we have for you we see

04:18.990 --> 04:21.670
the Endacott tree and Vandercook for etc..

04:21.900 --> 04:26.440
So by default always Aldie vindicates started in the same store.

04:26.640 --> 04:34.350
But in any reason you want to separate those two VM Dickey in two separate spot.

04:34.470 --> 04:42.180
You don't need to Abda VM disk Antti affinity that will separate the VM hard disk onto same Bastar would

04:42.250 --> 04:47.320
surprise the VM do you want to separate that out store.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.620
So this is not a route that you can.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.310
Are they two separate.

04:51.330 --> 04:55.260
Do local disk of virtual machine.

04:55.290 --> 05:01.770
So this is the idea about there is and still are there is a rule that's called affinity and Auntie affinity

05:02.150 --> 05:03.770
you see in the next video.
