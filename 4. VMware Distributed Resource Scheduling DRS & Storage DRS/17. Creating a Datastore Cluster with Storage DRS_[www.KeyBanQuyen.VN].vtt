00:01.690 --> 00:02.490
Hello again.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.590
So no will cover do stars.

00:05.620 --> 00:08.880
Dennis in the preview we work with the press.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.730
That's me in a debate of the brain or the virtual machine.

00:12.730 --> 00:18.540
That's me a resource of the Dushan machine that's used you and rant.

00:18.620 --> 00:22.050
No we're going to do stuff not depress me.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.490
Abdula bit of the body of the virtual machine.

00:25.690 --> 00:26.290
That's me.

00:26.420 --> 00:30.380
Our stodge Wii motion.

00:30.380 --> 00:37.730
So before we start the example of the stutterers lets me create some virtual machine some empty vision

00:37.730 --> 00:44.690
machine because the stars the rest will make our stars remission of those virtual machine and that will

00:44.690 --> 00:45.850
take a lot of time.

00:46.010 --> 00:50.390
As I told you I want to wait an hour until the process is complete.

00:50.390 --> 00:57.890
So for those I would create some empty virtual machine that will let me do the storage motion as quickly

00:57.920 --> 00:59.200
as possible.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.690
So for that I would create a new that your machine

01:06.580 --> 01:15.050
your virtual machine next then the virtual machine and from that that wasn't a miracle let's call it

01:15.050 --> 01:18.720
for example when seven

01:23.170 --> 01:30.380
dots next then we still do E6 I number but one next.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.050
Then we chose to put it into shape it's Trosch because it is a.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.870
We need to share it's trust and not to look at the past.

01:39.070 --> 01:47.690
So for example it puts them in London but what I Windows XP

01:50.360 --> 01:52.920
like thoughts next.

01:52.960 --> 02:01.120
And of course you see the direct route if you want to add some more but it's still not in public.

02:01.550 --> 02:10.320
So her next and finished before that let's give it a 10 revision

02:13.530 --> 02:18.820
then provision like that's OK next.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.570
And finish.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.640
Then we add another virtual machine.

02:28.500 --> 02:45.500
Next then when 7 03 like that next in the class or in D6 I won next day and we chose the one next and

02:45.620 --> 02:51.510
then next give it to Windows 7 for Gates and give it.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.130
If you want Windows XP

02:55.940 --> 02:56.750
like that.

02:56.840 --> 03:04.900
Next then into hardware let's try to give it to hardware to tried other option.

03:04.970 --> 03:13.750
So because in your hard disk of the first one we took you to Z gobshites storage.

03:13.750 --> 03:19.390
We did enjoy these capacities because of high order and Sagan Dujuan

03:24.160 --> 03:29.100
then probably provision next and finish.

03:29.120 --> 03:37.970
So now we have virtual machine that's bolted on to work as our real environment.

03:40.150 --> 03:42.790
Then the second one is on.

03:43.060 --> 03:48.370
No we have two virtual machine powered on that exist in the lot.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.320
Number one.

03:49.700 --> 03:56.600
So if we check law number one and shake it a virtual machine we have different machines and we have

03:56.600 --> 03:57.500
the Windows 7.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.600
Number two and Windows 7.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.620
Number three.

04:00.970 --> 04:04.610
So use those tools in our environment.

04:04.610 --> 04:10.330
Of course we need to create our data store clusters.

04:10.340 --> 04:17.250
So for that we click into the data center we have we got to storage and we have new data cluster.

04:17.270 --> 04:24.970
Of course we can't do it from displays or even from this place to me like that.

04:24.990 --> 04:29.550
We've got storage and we have a new data center cluster.

04:29.810 --> 04:30.680
So let's skip it.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.890
We do name that astore cluster to know that this is about to start.

04:35.060 --> 04:42.530
The cluster is about to host and this one for the class that we do our own storage DNS because we want

04:42.620 --> 04:44.840
active distorters next.

04:45.380 --> 04:49.330
Then the same as we did in do class start different option.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.050
When we enable the cluster.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.750
So we have not automation that's mean we'll be manually.

04:54.770 --> 05:00.820
It will give you an indication to make some start as motion and you need to accept it to do it.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.770
Then we have fully automated and the same odds as the preview of the cluster.

05:05.780 --> 05:09.990
The rest of the cluster we have the space balance.

05:10.100 --> 05:17.180
Me if you want to override the rule about to balance parliament the input output you want to do it automatically

05:17.180 --> 05:25.500
or manually then to rule on foetid automation for the rule if we in rule should be used to cluster seating

05:25.520 --> 05:31.110
or fully automated all manually then Polisi the VM invocation etc..

05:31.340 --> 05:35.330
So the same sitting as in do DNS.

05:35.480 --> 05:46.230
Then we click Next also had to chose the input output metric like what we did in memory and spew unit

05:46.440 --> 05:49.360
enabled input output metric for the start.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.940
That's mean instead of size.

05:51.950 --> 05:59.530
Also track the input output into stars then just be Sci-Fi's decision space.

05:59.540 --> 06:06.380
For example in ad it's important you need to take action then minimal freespace you reserve some minimal

06:06.380 --> 06:08.660
space for every shift it's trash.

06:08.660 --> 06:13.660
That means every shedded straws should have at least 15 gigabytes of free space.

06:13.850 --> 06:21.810
If any machine store will consume more space from this shaded storage and we have less than 15 gigabytes

06:21.830 --> 06:28.910
or so then the start address will take action and migrate do virtual machine from this shaded storage

06:28.910 --> 06:32.250
to another one and so on and so on.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.680
So next here we need to do a cluster that's mean different.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.210
That will be included in this dress Stosh.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.360
Of course we are standalone hosts and the cluster.

06:44.390 --> 06:53.360
We only have clusters Now if we click next and you need to get only do shared storage between the different

06:53.360 --> 06:57.610
and tossed you see to show that Astar connected to our host.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.600
This is the difference.

06:58.670 --> 07:05.900
Shedid stores or the store that's connected to different host in this cluster cluster that we have we

07:05.900 --> 07:13.760
have a 6 1 and 2 and 3 connected to do Love number one and number two if we chose to show that our store

07:13.760 --> 07:15.820
connected to same hosts.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.080
Mean only some see this.

07:18.090 --> 07:23.590
So you see the look at the start of the whole number want to look at that sort of the host number two

07:23.880 --> 07:30.650
and do look at the passport of E-6 I number three of course this one does not want to work for you in

07:30.990 --> 07:37.490
the press in the store at the rest because its need our shared storage to track all the host did show

07:37.490 --> 07:38.130
all of them.

07:38.150 --> 07:41.640
You can check the art of them.

07:41.780 --> 07:45.830
So in my situation we need to use that are still connected to the host.

07:45.860 --> 07:50.170
We select line 1 and 2 because using only one.

07:50.270 --> 07:58.130
Its not going to work for the storage there is need at least two shared storage unit to select both

07:58.220 --> 08:00.830
of them or maybe three four five etc..

08:01.040 --> 08:05.610
The minimum is to shedded trash so we click next.

08:05.660 --> 08:13.820
Here is a quick overview about it then finish and the stars press will be enabled in this data center

08:14.100 --> 08:14.760
by 10.
