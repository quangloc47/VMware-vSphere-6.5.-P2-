Hello again.

00:02.350 --> 00:10.380
So as you are our manager or the fear of your environment and you actually have to dress in your environment

00:10.590 --> 00:15.990
and the next day when you're back to work you want to know what happened in your environment to get

00:15.990 --> 00:21.600
an idea about the dress and a difference action happened to your environment.

00:21.600 --> 00:27.180
So for that you simply got a little cluster into monitor of course how you see the difference monitor

00:27.360 --> 00:28.050
option.

00:28.050 --> 00:31.650
Then we got to do this fair they dress like that.

00:31.740 --> 00:39.640
And here you can see any recommendation if you remember if we chose a dress to be manually.

00:39.900 --> 00:48.170
And when you get into dress head you will see lots of occasion massage in yellow color that depressed

00:48.220 --> 00:50.490
or commanded to do this migration.

00:50.490 --> 00:52.180
Number one admit Reason number two.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.040
That's it.

00:53.220 --> 01:01.380
So when you get the notification off come on date migration in your cluster you've got to monitor and

01:01.380 --> 01:03.520
there you check different recommendation.

01:03.540 --> 01:09.100
You see there is an accommodation check the one that you want and click Apply recommendation to do the

01:09.110 --> 01:09.510
migration.

01:09.510 --> 01:16.800
For example if you please this virtual machine Windows XP number five need to be migrated from E6.

01:16.830 --> 01:19.030
I won't do it because I do.

01:19.190 --> 01:23.190
So you click up in accommodation the immigration start manually.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.250
Then another accommodation etc..

01:25.290 --> 01:31.290
Or you can chose the randiness no to get any recommendation.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.420
So then we have fought any fault happened throughout the operation.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.580
This one happened as opposed to hard.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.480
I have an issue with the veteran machine ideality.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.640
Then we get to historic to see the difference.

01:44.850 --> 01:48.080
If for example in my situation we use fairly automated.

01:48.150 --> 01:54.150
Then I come the next day and want to know if something happened about a difference between machine and

01:54.310 --> 01:56.790
see the difference migration happening.

01:56.790 --> 02:04.820
So for example at 5:00 pm do Windows 7 on hosts number is X I want that's me.

02:04.830 --> 02:09.660
This virtual machine migrated to do is X I one day at 5.

02:09.700 --> 02:17.390
Don't you want the Windows XP number 5 or host is if I won then another one in the host E6 I won all

02:17.820 --> 02:18.590
of these.

02:18.610 --> 02:29.790
Then at 6pm the Windows XP number 5 migrated from E-6 I to do is X. I won then placed Windows XP on

02:29.790 --> 02:32.320
Haast E6 I treat it.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.240
So the different migration happened in the DNS.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.780
You can watch they are right there.

02:40.020 --> 02:47.160
Then of course you can see that this huge ization to what's happened in your are stupid is because I

02:47.160 --> 02:56.080
want have some real color I mean we have some overloading in speed because this one is the center server.

02:56.220 --> 03:03.360
That's why I always have overruled in industry a dim memory then memory zation is effects I want consume

03:03.630 --> 03:10.310
much memory because I have to be center server asix I want to and network connection.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.960
If use the network connection from different Tulse depends on just one.

03:16.080 --> 03:21.720
Windows XP have a connection to the server that are connected to internet.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.600
You can see the consumation of the network from here.

03:26.010 --> 03:34.690
So this is a different option that you can monitor the DNS Sinixt will start to stodge DNS.

03:34.710 --> 03:35.520
So the next.
