00:01.100 --> 00:04.390
Hello and welcome in this note section about do.

00:04.560 --> 00:11.490
There is another important future of the team where Vistaprint 6.5 is due DNS.

00:11.510 --> 00:16.140
So what is DNS.

00:16.300 --> 00:23.100
Before we start you should know that we have to clean up the various standard DNS like what we see in

00:23.100 --> 00:28.230
the ocean and do stars dress like stars.

00:29.320 --> 00:33.940
And of course the dearest is have a big relation with the motion.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.200
So what you do.

00:36.220 --> 00:42.010
Dearest sought the dearest meaning distributed resouce scheduler.

00:42.180 --> 00:43.220
That's me.

00:43.280 --> 00:51.880
It's how and the relation about the resource of the hardware of it a bit in you that doesn't so its

00:51.880 --> 00:57.650
function is simply balance and restores ization across cluster nodes.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.350
That's me in the house.

00:59.690 --> 01:00.760
That's me.

01:00.810 --> 01:05.600
The DNS will balance the research digitisation Haeckel's different hosts.

01:05.620 --> 01:12.690
But before we have the ability to dress we have something Galut cluster.

01:12.870 --> 01:16.910
So the cluster it is fairly important.

01:16.960 --> 01:22.570
Before we start using as and the is.

01:23.080 --> 01:31.820
So our view centers that we need to create the cluster before we'll be able to use the DNS and all the

01:31.940 --> 01:39.070
upcoming future only the revolution can work without the cluster but from the DNS and from the other

01:39.480 --> 01:42.540
upcoming future you need to have a cluster.

01:42.580 --> 01:45.570
So the cluster is our requirement.

01:45.580 --> 01:52.500
Option 2 is the other upcoming future of VM where.

01:52.710 --> 01:59.030
So what is the class cluster is like a container that will content the different host of your data center.

01:59.030 --> 02:05.990
For example you have thousands of hosts in your data center you separated those hosts in a different

02:05.990 --> 02:07.990
cluster like a different continent.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.880
For example 10 server for 10 Haast for for example a specific service and not a 20 and 7 for a single

02:17.960 --> 02:23.950
service in your company and another dirty host for another service etc..

02:24.050 --> 02:31.280
So the cluster created to help you to separate the two different service and apply different rules for

02:31.400 --> 02:32.020
those costs.

02:32.030 --> 02:39.740
Its like you surprised the host inside a folder for his home folder a Folder B and folder C and apply

02:39.740 --> 02:42.580
some specific rules for any of those file.

02:42.890 --> 02:47.540
So this is an important step to go Drog the dearest.

02:47.750 --> 02:56.680
So there is simply its balance the resource ization across Hulst or across cluster nodes.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.550
So next we'll see the difference.

02:58.620 --> 03:04.430
Dearest dearest we have in a VM where this very small fine soon to next be.
