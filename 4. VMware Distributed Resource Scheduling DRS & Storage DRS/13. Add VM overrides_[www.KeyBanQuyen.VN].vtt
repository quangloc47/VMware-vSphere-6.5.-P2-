WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:02.630
Elegant.

00:02.690 --> 00:08.250
So another option that we talk about it in the preview it's due V.M. over.

00:08.290 --> 00:09.060
Right.

00:09.230 --> 00:15.680
This option will be available only if you chills into details to enable do the improv right.

00:16.880 --> 00:26.210
If you disable the VM overnight in this place right there if you just want the VM.

00:26.210 --> 00:26.660
All right.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.690
We're not going to work right.

00:30.760 --> 00:40.520
That's you in not have been a mission to do this task.

00:40.540 --> 00:49.080
So you see it does not show us any option to it it even if we add our virtual machine.

00:49.090 --> 01:01.020
So before you will be able to do the right you need to enable it from do the rest sitting.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.390
So in the DNS we need to enable

01:05.950 --> 01:15.550
video virtual machine automation level then click OK then we back to the VM override and we chose up

01:15.950 --> 01:20.970
on VM override and then we we are on veteran machine.

01:21.180 --> 01:27.530
In my situation I want to exclude when center front or dead is to avoid any migration.

01:27.540 --> 01:34.440
Of course he can't migrate this machine because it's consumed about changing about of the rent and the

01:34.500 --> 01:34.990
other.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.640
Yes I do not have 10 gigabytes of Raw.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.620
So let's just exclude.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.590
No we have this option is available.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.660
As you see here we can use the clusters.

01:45.710 --> 01:46.390
That's me.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.250
This machine shall respect the rule of the cluster.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.060
Then we can chose fully automated.

01:52.340 --> 01:59.300
That's mean in case that you have the RSA cluster configured it to be manually or to be partially or

01:59.360 --> 02:03.230
automatically you can make this machine fully automated that's me.

02:03.240 --> 02:10.680
If the cluster the rest of the cluster see that this machine should be migrated from it is because I

02:10.680 --> 02:14.010
treat Isak's I want he can do it automatically.

02:14.040 --> 02:21.500
Even if I chose to configure the DNS as manually This is the option of the following magic but in our

02:21.510 --> 02:29.220
tradition which is fully automatic so we can use partially automated that's mean second option or do

02:29.280 --> 02:29.960
manually.

02:29.970 --> 02:36.320
That's mean he can migrate any virtual machine to get the right balance in the cluster.

02:36.480 --> 02:44.380
But if he does stay to migrate to this machine but when Center him need to get my permission to do it.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.800
Then we have the disable that's me.

02:46.830 --> 02:49.200
Disable this virtual machine from the master.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.090
That's mean the rest of this cluster.

02:52.140 --> 02:59.460
Don't do anything to this machine and this option that we're going to do in my situation to avoid any

02:59.460 --> 03:02.130
attack happened or on to this virtual machine.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.190
So we click OK.

03:03.300 --> 03:12.120
No we have the route of the VM override in do when Santror of course we can add any virtual machine

03:12.570 --> 03:15.720
and onny as much as you want.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.580
So for example to machine.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.090
OK you give it some option.

03:20.190 --> 03:26.620
Bastiaan Folley manually or disable then this option is not available for now.

03:26.790 --> 03:36.590
And of course we have some other fear rule and configuration and the video machine automation LaVette

03:36.680 --> 03:37.980
is enabled.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.710
This is a quick overview about the dress.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.030
It's funny on my tip so you know which one you should chose.

03:44.040 --> 03:49.350
Right component to do the rest of course will cancel this option right now.

03:49.550 --> 03:50.680
So this is the V.M..

03:50.690 --> 03:51.230
All right.

03:51.260 --> 03:53.580
So next we'll see Sam V.M. House.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.010
Good to see you in the next.
