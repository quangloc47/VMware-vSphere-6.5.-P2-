Blogging.

00:01.950 --> 00:08.180
So let's start the practical part of do DNS and storage DNS.

00:08.460 --> 00:16.570
So as I told you in the beginning of this section when we want to enable the data as in our environment

00:16.900 --> 00:20.250
we need to have our cluster.

00:20.260 --> 00:26.860
So for example if we go to the center and try to get something about Darrow's we can't find it if we

00:26.860 --> 00:30.270
go to the coffee we don't see any option about do.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.390
There is also a delivery of the host.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.020
We don't have any data as option.

00:36.280 --> 00:42.370
And at the same of the that doesn't matter if we go to the data center we don't have any option at all

00:42.380 --> 00:43.710
to do that.

00:43.870 --> 00:49.830
So for those we need to create our cluster to be able to do their best option.

00:49.840 --> 00:57.100
So for that we go to deliver it to the center we click on it and we have new cluster.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.400
We click on it.

00:58.460 --> 01:02.850
It's simple it's like when we create our center and the same hair.

01:02.900 --> 01:05.900
We going to use do your cluster.

01:06.310 --> 01:09.900
So we give it a name for example just lets make it a cluster.

01:09.940 --> 01:13.310
So you know that we talk about cluster.

01:13.390 --> 01:18.760
Of course we have different option to enable to do this for heights of humanity.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.850
EVC and Vicent will see those.

01:21.930 --> 01:23.290
Option one by one.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.710
So we click OK.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.900
Then the cluster just added right of course.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.370
In this case it's still empty.

01:33.740 --> 01:44.220
So we just simply drag and drop the horse from the data center to the cluster like that.

01:44.270 --> 01:50.050
The second one OK and the one like that's.

01:50.810 --> 01:56.700
And then of course you can create more clusters if you remember at the beginning to do you that you

01:56.700 --> 02:03.940
can add cluster inhalation about the environment.

02:03.960 --> 02:10.110
So for example this cluster for service in them but I'm not a cluster service number b for example two

02:10.110 --> 02:16.770
of our series that need height powerful servers you create a cluster for that.

02:16.860 --> 02:23.550
And our host we hide a resource inside that cluster and didn't give it some specific route and you would

02:23.550 --> 02:27.870
see later some different rules that need different cluster.

02:27.870 --> 02:35.850
For example those high performance host will use it for the heights of your ability service and server.

02:36.150 --> 02:42.970
Then you give it some form for rules that will keep your host your virtual machine always available.

02:43.230 --> 02:50.050
But for a service that's how powerful host you are they are in a specific cluster.

02:50.160 --> 02:56.330
Give it some low level configuration and low libertaria as a rule etc..

02:56.580 --> 02:59.580
So just to get the idea why we need more cluster

03:03.310 --> 03:08.790
with click the two delays this cluster and we use only our cluster.

03:08.930 --> 03:13.280
So no if we click on the cluster you will get a quick idea about it.

03:13.370 --> 03:19.850
And of course it's the same as that doesn't really give your all part of the resource in the different

03:20.420 --> 03:20.990
hosts.

03:21.030 --> 03:21.510
Right.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.140
And a difference but your machine.

03:23.540 --> 03:29.690
And when we go to config No we have the option of the despair there as.
