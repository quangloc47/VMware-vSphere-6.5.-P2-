WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:05.970
Then we have another option right held the virtual machine automation will Bogstad have predicted.

00:06.180 --> 00:13.100
But let's now see the virtual machine automation enable individual virtual machine automation level.

00:13.590 --> 00:14.210
That's me.

00:14.290 --> 00:14.980
All right.

00:14.990 --> 00:21.270
And the beauty of virtual machine can be switched from a virtual machine override beige.

00:21.350 --> 00:27.650
When we disable this option that's mean rule of the dress will apply to all the virtual machine inside

00:27.650 --> 00:29.150
this cluster.

00:29.270 --> 00:36.590
But in any case you want to make some different dress route for those machine inside the cluster.

00:36.650 --> 00:41.990
You need to enable virtual machine automation level.

00:42.510 --> 00:49.640
And this is the case that if for example our virtual machine have two or three or maybe four terabytes

00:49.670 --> 00:50.730
of data.

00:50.840 --> 00:55.440
You need to exclude these virtual machine from the stars D-Rays.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.530
So this option lets you to make this configuration.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.730
Also the affinity route that's it there.

01:01.940 --> 01:08.720
So always do enable this option if you want to exclude or to do some rule for a specific virtual machine

01:08.750 --> 01:09.860
in your environment.

01:10.100 --> 01:14.720
And we'll see an example for this machine machine center.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.150
Then we have predictive dear as if we inhabit this one.

01:20.210 --> 01:27.370
In addition to time metric D-Rays will respond to forecast metric provided by the realities.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.090
The it is Operation server.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.250
This is another tool from the view point.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.750
You need to add it to to the center.

01:34.760 --> 01:41.100
Of course there are some other course about the rallies that show you how to do the reality.

01:41.210 --> 01:44.940
It's like a plugging you added to the center server.

01:45.130 --> 01:53.810
And the realease operations server like a monitor server that will go into monitor your environment

01:54.170 --> 02:03.520
you're trusted on a different server and will help with the DNS to take action in the right time.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.490
Let's get an idea about it.

02:06.500 --> 02:15.420
So for example you have an environment that's constant thousands of vitriol machine and do Iranians

02:15.570 --> 02:21.220
keep monitoring the different data as action ticket in your environment after a specific time.

02:21.230 --> 02:28.790
For example after a one or two month he discovered that you have about 10 machines in a virtual machine.

02:29.130 --> 02:38.130
Always have a high low then in the resource outside of every month was on to last week of the month

02:38.640 --> 02:43.870
those 10 virtual machines always have a high to loading of the resource.

02:43.890 --> 02:52.140
So he predicts that at the next month again at the last seven day of the month the virtual machine will

02:52.140 --> 02:54.740
consume more resouce.

02:54.780 --> 03:01.970
So for that he predicts for that and it took action before the seven day.

03:02.090 --> 03:09.930
For example before the virtual machine start consuming hide loading of the research for about three

03:10.170 --> 03:19.200
or four days before that creates the right environment for those virtual machine by migrating them to

03:19.200 --> 03:24.650
the other hosts that will go in to provide the right resource for this huge machine.

03:24.900 --> 03:33.570
Or for example minimize other virtual machine from that host for example you have five hosts and every

03:33.570 --> 03:42.230
host have about five machines and five machine how to machine that have over loading at last seven days

03:42.270 --> 03:43.060
of the month.

03:43.320 --> 03:53.720
So the dress will make great the other treat machine that exists with does too overloading vitriol machine

03:53.750 --> 03:55.930
in the host to another hosts.

03:55.970 --> 04:05.880
So at the last four years or eight or nine day of the month the host number one the top five machines

04:06.120 --> 04:09.050
will only have only two virtual machine.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.050
That's not a high loading.

04:11.310 --> 04:16.750
So when does vision machine start consuming more resource.

04:16.760 --> 04:28.630
Rhonda Stroupe they can use all the resource of the server for them together and no other virtual machine

04:28.630 --> 04:31.860
will consume the resource with those to your machine.

04:32.020 --> 04:41.020
So this is the idea of do predict DNS it will predict any overloading in our virtual machine in a specific

04:41.020 --> 04:41.400
time.

04:41.590 --> 04:44.680
And he will take action before that time happens.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.480
And this is very helpful for this company.

04:47.500 --> 04:54.700
The big company for example does a campaign for example like a bank the bank that's have an overloading

04:55.180 --> 05:03.340
the end of the month or as the beginning of the month when our clients start getting money or transaction

05:03.370 --> 05:04.110
et cetera.

05:04.330 --> 05:12.220
So the details predicts Dennis will create a good environment for those virtual machine that is responsible

05:12.220 --> 05:16.890
for transaction or to the beginning of the month.

05:16.990 --> 05:24.910
Then after the seven day passes then we'll rebalance do environment and migrate the other machine to

05:24.910 --> 05:30.190
the right place for the cluster load balancing.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.590
So this is the products.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.780
Also we have some other option additional option.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.580
We'll see it in the next video.
