WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:09.270
So when he complete the data center cluster you can't see it's from displays or whatever you need to

00:09.270 --> 00:11.500
go to the store right.

00:11.510 --> 00:19.440
And then you see we have a data store cluster and if you remember when we was in Morocco data center

00:19.470 --> 00:23.400
we see the different store that was the 1 2 and 3.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.930
Then do lunch one and lunch.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.080
No the loved one and learn to become inside the store cluster.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.880
Seat lunch and lunch.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.480
Inside do cluster of the datastore we can't see that our stock was up on display.

00:39.510 --> 00:46.290
We only see it from here and from this place you can create are a data store cluster as the same as

00:46.290 --> 00:47.690
we did into one.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.750
So when we click onto datastore cluster you see a quick overview of it.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.580
The monitor and do coffee.

00:55.800 --> 01:03.210
And here we have some simple configuration do start with DNS as you see here fully automated then the

01:03.210 --> 01:09.770
different option used the cluster sieging the input output metric and some other option.

01:09.780 --> 01:13.070
Do other then one by one.

01:13.210 --> 01:16.930
How do you see the default of an e-ticket VM decie together by default.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.280
This is the default one.

01:18.310 --> 01:26.830
If you remember the VM decie of every virtual machine that by default created in the same spot then

01:26.830 --> 01:28.620
check in balance every eight hours.

01:28.660 --> 01:29.490
That's mean.

01:29.630 --> 01:38.370
Every hour we'll check in balance for our store because the store had a big file.

01:38.440 --> 01:45.820
When we talk about the stores dearest we talk about big size do files for the virtual machine have five

01:45.850 --> 01:50.630
or ten gigabytes of stars on a machine have wondered about or not.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.540
So it is impossible to keep a chicken do that.

01:53.540 --> 01:57.640
I thought every minute or second it is illogical.

01:57.640 --> 02:06.400
You need to wait about eight hours to check do new information from the data store and decide if we

02:06.400 --> 02:12.670
need to make a migration off of our storage from a should it's just another sheet it's.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.180
And some other option of course you can get it from.

02:16.210 --> 02:16.840
Right.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.130
Right.

02:17.120 --> 02:23.520
Had the same automated etc but as this is need 8 hour.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.980
So the stores will take action after each hour.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.220
He will check the different line and take action.

02:30.220 --> 02:39.330
After about a tout and we see the storage emotion start automatically but of course we want wait an

02:39.400 --> 02:40.020
hour.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.600
So we have the VM override if we want to overwrite something that your machine.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.460
And we have some rules.

02:45.640 --> 02:52.060
So let's create some room to see our life example of the storage the emotion.

02:52.120 --> 03:00.340
So we click out then we enable of course we need to enable the route that we want and we have VM Aunty

03:00.400 --> 03:02.120
affinity.

03:02.310 --> 03:08.290
Let's start with DVM and Jaffee that's meant on virtual disk of the listed that your machine should

03:08.300 --> 03:10.560
be plus it on different store.

03:11.100 --> 03:18.650
And we click on the right hand and check the difference between machines that we have and the data store

03:18.780 --> 03:20.290
that's used.

03:20.340 --> 03:25.090
So head to the rule say anti affinity.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.010
That's me.

03:26.010 --> 03:33.310
This virtual machine should not be started with a modern virtual machine or maybe the virtual machine

03:33.310 --> 03:37.230
will never started in one shaded storage.

03:37.230 --> 03:45.210
So for that if we check what is on plan 1 how Windows 7 Number 2 and Windows 7 Number 3 and I want to

03:45.210 --> 03:51.120
go to those Windows 7 Number one because it halved the operating system and this virtual machine have

03:51.120 --> 03:52.860
a size about 8 gigabytes.

03:52.890 --> 03:58.830
And we'll take a lot of time to migrate the start of this machine from land want to.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.550
So we're going to do Windows 7.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.130
Number two and Windows 7.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.110
Number three that's have a small size.

04:06.720 --> 04:16.530
So the condition that we write here is the virtual machine of Windows 7 of the number two and three

04:17.520 --> 04:26.740
should be in the front storage or indifferent lot like that.

04:26.850 --> 04:33.630
So the idea that we want the virtual machine number two and virtual machine.

04:33.650 --> 04:38.600
But we always have Auntie affinity of the different story.

04:38.850 --> 04:47.910
So we click OK no it should stop our story as Mission migration to migrate to the virtual machine 2

04:48.020 --> 04:53.180
or 3 from the land one to mother land the land that is available is land number two.

04:53.180 --> 05:01.280
If you are in a land three or four who will decide which one shawled has this vitriol machine.

05:01.470 --> 05:07.640
So let's just give it a little time and this room will start applying chose the other rule.

05:07.720 --> 05:16.350
We like that VM Dickie affinity virtual machine you need to choose only one virtual machine you can

05:16.440 --> 05:23.910
chose to Vitry in Washington in the in decie onto affinity because of the decie is at the level of vitriol

05:23.910 --> 05:24.580
machine.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.040
So you see Windows 7.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.360
Number three it's migrated from LAN one to land.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.980
If we check the data right here migrate win 7 Number three front is excited the last one is x.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.480
I treat land all in Oracle.

05:39.600 --> 05:46.930
So the rule work perfectly émigrés the stars and you see it's about 100 percent because the harddrive

05:46.980 --> 05:52.150
of this virtual machine is about three megabytes.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.740
So it happened quickly.

05:53.820 --> 06:01.020
If we do this route on the Windows 7 Number one the top two operation system it will take about 1 hour

06:01.170 --> 06:03.170
to complete the process.

06:03.300 --> 06:08.280
So we're back to the other group the VM decay Auntie affinity.

06:08.630 --> 06:11.490
Let's me this action happen.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.530
Abdula get a virtual machine.

06:13.530 --> 06:15.710
So we chose only one virtual machine.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.650
If you remember the virtual machine and BR3 have to driver click OK.

06:20.850 --> 06:30.520
So you see the hard drive and hard drive and number two Sinixt up list to get to VM decie sort see like

06:30.520 --> 06:30.720
that.

06:30.760 --> 06:36.820
No we can complete the process if we only want to detect at least two virtual disk.

06:36.940 --> 06:45.130
So we need at least two virtual disk and when we create this route that's made it will save our hard

06:45.130 --> 06:51.770
disk number one in our loved one and the hard disk number two in Ireland to the opposite Diskin number

06:51.770 --> 06:56.960
one in the last two and this number two in the last one.

06:56.960 --> 07:05.350
So this is the root of the Dekhi Auntie affinity because by default VM decie created in the same LAN.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.980
If you don't chill's in a run automatically saved the hard disk number one on the hard disk number two

07:11.000 --> 07:12.530
in the same LAN.

07:12.560 --> 07:17.260
So there are no option about affiant it's only about Auntie affinity.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.070
You need to separate them.

07:19.120 --> 07:26.390
So this option we're not going to do it because it we have a week this one day if we back to the virtual

07:26.390 --> 07:27.410
machine.

07:27.830 --> 07:34.180
And as the sim right hand we click on it and we chose to do stitching.

07:34.610 --> 07:39.920
Of course you remember the seating of every video machine we have a job that's it is called DNS that's

07:39.920 --> 07:46.880
mean stylized the there is no it is enable and you see the storage room that is connected to this material

07:46.880 --> 07:47.600
machine.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.180
We click on it.

07:49.370 --> 07:58.130
And here we have some other new rule available VM decie affinity by default you still have the VM decie

07:58.130 --> 08:03.890
up and it's a cluster of default VM afine to ease keep them together.

08:03.920 --> 08:12.850
I told you from the other place that by default VM were saved do the VM decie at the same LAN.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.870
So here we have the entity VM decie anti affinity.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.000
So we chose local hard drive.

08:20.020 --> 08:23.650
One on the hard or two for the virtual machine.

08:24.260 --> 08:32.690
Then we chose that this hard level should always separated into different shared trash then we have

08:32.730 --> 08:34.510
the VM on the iPhone.

08:34.750 --> 08:35.570
That's mean.

08:35.690 --> 08:41.210
This virtual machine shilled Antti affinity with another machine here automatically chose this one because

08:41.210 --> 08:43.040
we chose the option on this one.

08:43.130 --> 08:49.520
So we click add and add another machine that you want to separate this machine to it from the same last.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.630
This condition is already separated.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.730
We have this one in Law Number two on this white and black number one.

08:56.750 --> 09:03.560
So the route will keep all with any store data as happened in the future we never collected this virtual

09:03.560 --> 09:04.100
machine.

09:04.100 --> 09:13.490
Windows XP and Windows 7 in the same shape it's always keep them in separate slash and VM affinity is

09:13.490 --> 09:16.550
do by default all division machine by default.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.370
Keep them in the same shared storage.

09:20.270 --> 09:25.320
So the same if we chose any of those between machine this one that is bolted on.

09:25.610 --> 09:29.970
So you can't do it from either system or you simply go to config.

09:30.200 --> 09:36.620
And here you have the hardware and VM option and the VM is a direct route.

09:36.680 --> 09:43.280
You can get it right there and chose to add in a rule that you want to do a virtual machine.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.520
So the same.

09:45.590 --> 09:51.900
So this is the different storage DNS option that we have in the rest of the VM world.

09:51.920 --> 09:58.010
So if you have any other situation that you want to discuss with us into a discussion of the course

09:58.310 --> 10:00.050
please share it in due course.

10:00.080 --> 10:07.040
It will be good if you share some screen capture of your lot and let us know the different situations

10:07.040 --> 10:11.500
that you can create start with the press and do rule.

10:11.690 --> 10:15.850
So we'll see you in the next section with another future overdue.

10:15.950 --> 10:17.450
VM we're Bespin.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.590
So thank you.
