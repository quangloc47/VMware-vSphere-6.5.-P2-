00:00.630 --> 00:01.430
Help again.

00:01.620 --> 00:07.170
So no as you see the Windows 7 migrated from.

00:07.240 --> 00:12.540
I want to Isak's I too know it exist in E6 I do.

00:12.670 --> 00:16.720
And the other part is on mission machines did in E6.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.130
I won.

00:18.130 --> 00:25.840
So for example we want to get an overload in four to six i.e. too with going to power a modern machine.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.360
That's yes I do.

00:27.520 --> 00:34.180
And in that case the defense will start migrating up between the machine from this host to another host

00:34.600 --> 00:38.070
to get our good balance in in a cluster.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.880
So we parted on this virtual machine

00:42.700 --> 00:45.170
will take all little time just show up

00:49.810 --> 00:51.000
of console.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.420
We see it in the console point.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.950
It would be following up on.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.930
So how does it do windows thought about it on the e6.

00:59.930 --> 01:03.290
I number one start getting overloading

01:07.360 --> 01:13.390
so its stock onstream memory is excite you also keep consuming the memory.

01:13.430 --> 01:15.950
The Windows 7 exist in Isak's.

01:15.980 --> 01:19.660
I threw the Windows XP into it.

01:19.700 --> 01:26.520
I want and also do Windows XP exist in is x.

01:26.530 --> 01:33.300
I want to have two machine Isak's one and one machine.

01:33.370 --> 01:34.930
Yes I do.

01:35.230 --> 01:43.960
So we should see an over loading in one of those that your machine and do the rest should start migrating

01:44.290 --> 01:48.300
one of those virtual machines to another host.

01:48.310 --> 01:53.130
So for example lets power off do Windows 7 exist in is x.

01:53.160 --> 01:53.730
I host.

01:53.770 --> 01:58.050
So will have zero machine potted on it is x.

01:58.060 --> 02:02.760
I Harsin them Perdo But I mean we have free space inside.

02:02.950 --> 02:07.420
And then we shall take one of those spotted machine from E6.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.840
I host number one and migrate you to do is X I hold them virtual.

02:12.070 --> 02:14.760
So let's get inside this one.

02:14.820 --> 02:18.910
We try to power off this machine.

02:21.520 --> 02:34.760
So like dots we click shut down.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.470
The other wants to bring it on

02:42.020 --> 02:48.810
OK the machine stockpot it off while our own virtual machine.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.680
And this one would be pulling it off

02:53.610 --> 03:00.120
and we shall see a migration to one of those top machine from Isak's.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.450
I want to excite you or is excite me.

03:04.530 --> 03:05.850
He chose the best one.

03:06.090 --> 03:17.280
But in this situation we had to do what is three we check the resource of this is exciting.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.920
So it's still constituted a memoir.

03:23.990 --> 03:34.330
For the ethics I operate in system so the virtual machine number four and number five still run in is

03:34.480 --> 03:38.020
I want and do Windows 7.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.030
You just bought it on E6.

03:40.080 --> 03:40.670
I do.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.630
So it's consumes Zettel.

03:43.820 --> 03:56.750
This one costing about 100 gigabytes of rain is excite to also assume about 300 of megabytes or 400

03:56.870 --> 04:00.090
megabytes offering.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.400
So this one is part of the oath let's close it.

04:02.460 --> 04:07.070
This wants to on it on and we shall see.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.950
Our hot nigger nation.

04:09.070 --> 04:11.070
So let's give it a little time.

04:14.730 --> 04:17.460
So the Windows 7 is bolted on.

04:17.460 --> 04:27.220
If we try to run some task right there for example we try to open Internet browser and we make some

04:27.760 --> 04:34.330
overloading of do resource like that.

04:34.410 --> 04:40.620
So the press will detect any consumption of the results from the host.

04:40.620 --> 04:47.000
Number one it acts like one and will start doing the migration

05:07.090 --> 05:07.550
OK.

05:07.590 --> 05:12.260
As you say you had no do as of migrating to Windows XP.

05:12.270 --> 05:26.570
Number 5 fall is I want to see at the same time 5 to 8 task migrate virtual machine a hot migration.

05:26.590 --> 05:36.580
Win XP number 5 is X I want lunch one in Morocco to E-6 to land one in Morocco with encryption migrating

05:37.000 --> 05:42.780
VM X beat 5 of Haast IX I want in Morrocco.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.620
So its worked perfectly.

05:44.640 --> 05:49.510
No denigrations start automatically from Isak's.

05:49.510 --> 05:54.920
I want to use X I too have more resource.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.800
So it will take a little time.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.200
And of course the virtual machine number five still about it.

06:01.290 --> 06:08.800
Of course you need just to refresh the console because the console need to refresh to get contact with

06:08.800 --> 06:09.250
the machine.

06:09.250 --> 06:14.420
But if the VM Walkstation the machine will still work without any problem.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.760
So you see it's work perfectly.

06:16.780 --> 06:20.130
The new machine migrated from Essex.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.340
I took it because I want it.

06:23.350 --> 06:27.100
We check like that.

06:27.230 --> 06:27.920
I won.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.580
It was in E6 I wonder what it's become.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.300
Yes I do.

06:32.790 --> 06:33.280
That's me.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.950
This machine migrated Fronde.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.230
If I want to I to succeed really.

06:38.250 --> 06:45.010
If we check this one as you see here the result of the migration depress migrated to Windows XP number

06:45.010 --> 06:46.240
five or 6.

06:46.330 --> 06:50.310
I want to in cluster it cluster.

06:50.320 --> 06:56.070
The name of this one is cluster in Morocco so it's work perfectly.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.790
So to say if we found any machine from one of.

07:00.900 --> 07:09.020
I can't get overloaded Automattic leaders will migrate this machine from a host to another host.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.020
So this is the difference.

07:11.050 --> 07:11.820
Example.

07:12.860 --> 07:23.580
Do a man function of the press in any cluster so to have seat more option of the DNS to see the next.
