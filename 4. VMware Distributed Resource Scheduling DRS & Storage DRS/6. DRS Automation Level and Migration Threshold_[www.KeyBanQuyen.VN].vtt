WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:09.340
And when we go to config No we have the option of the sphere there as before we can't find any option

00:09.370 --> 00:11.980
college whispered there is no it is available.

00:12.060 --> 00:15.990
The different surveys that we can use Drog to cluster.

00:16.290 --> 00:22.620
So we click on to visit Darrow's we got to it is of course we have option to get of dress but no we

00:22.620 --> 00:23.780
click on we did.

00:24.210 --> 00:28.760
And we need to enable the terrorists in this cluster.

00:29.110 --> 00:33.740
So simply click Duren on this for us on this cluster.

00:33.990 --> 00:40.570
So if we click OK I enabled the DNS and he will walk by using the default configuration.

00:40.590 --> 00:45.000
So let's discover do a different configuration we have into the press.

00:45.120 --> 00:53.710
So the first one is there is automation and you see of course head it is folly be manually or automated.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.430
We click on it to get more detail.

00:57.450 --> 01:04.050
So the option the first one manually that's mean something is to just migration.

01:04.050 --> 01:10.440
If you remember when we talk about the dress we use the expression migration we make great the virtual

01:10.440 --> 01:13.750
machine from house to house or from storage to store.

01:13.860 --> 01:21.010
So when we chose manually Vicenzo said Wiens to just migration a recommendation for virtual machine.

01:21.240 --> 01:21.970
That's me.

01:22.020 --> 01:30.420
When he discover that a virtual machine will be migrated from Hulst 8 host B it will give you our suggestion

01:30.540 --> 01:37.330
and then you need to take action and do it manually degrade this virtual machine from a to b.

01:37.680 --> 01:45.220
Then we have the option Parsa automatically Vitry a machine will be automatically plus it onto a host

01:45.330 --> 01:46.360
at power on.

01:46.390 --> 01:50.830
And the center's role was to just migration accommodation for virtual machine.

01:50.890 --> 01:58.360
That means it will do the function partially and will give you notice that this machine will be run

01:58.360 --> 01:59.150
in this one.

01:59.260 --> 02:02.820
If you accept it it will be passed it automatically.

02:02.950 --> 02:08.460
If not it will stay at the same place they have for the automatic.

02:08.470 --> 02:15.340
That's mean the DNS work alone without need any interaction from you the virtual machine will be automatically

02:15.340 --> 02:21.130
plus it onto a host when powered on and will be automatically migrated from one house to another to

02:21.130 --> 02:23.250
optimize it resource usage.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.830
It will do Calcott automatically and chose do right.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.910
Migration needed for a different virtual machine.

02:30.220 --> 02:39.940
And of course we always always choose the automated but in any reason you can manually or Marcial automatic

02:40.330 --> 02:47.290
because you have a small amount of virtual machine you can use manually to keep track of what's happened

02:47.290 --> 02:48.490
in your environment.

02:48.760 --> 02:55.990
For the smart environment but for those big environment it is always recommended to use fully automated

02:56.110 --> 02:59.990
to have safe environment.

03:00.130 --> 03:06.100
Then we have the negotiation trees hauled we have conservative and accuracy.

03:06.190 --> 03:15.950
If we move this one you have different lawin to migrate the virtual machine in your cluster.

03:16.100 --> 03:25.250
So the conservative I mean we're not going to migrate a virtual machine just by seeing some over loading

03:25.270 --> 03:29.760
hey we need to slow down do migration process.

03:29.840 --> 03:35.600
You see right there on the server will only apply a recommendation that must be taken to satisfy the

03:35.600 --> 03:37.290
cluster constraint.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.620
Like afine to rude and host maintenance.

03:40.790 --> 03:42.140
That's me.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.890
Will use them.

03:43.940 --> 03:50.520
The motion to migrate virtual machine only if there are some of each route can be if you are a route

03:50.520 --> 03:55.170
that this machine will never run at the same host with this other machine.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.040
So what we can do will be Gracedieu.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.650
One of those virtual machines machine to the host.

03:59.870 --> 04:05.900
And also if you have unhorsed in a maintenance mode he will migrate to some machine from the toast to

04:06.060 --> 04:06.630
other holes.

04:06.680 --> 04:11.370
So all those virtual machine will be available for your company.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.390
So this is the big one.

04:13.460 --> 04:19.310
Also if we got to that level to the center server will apply to accommodation that probably is a significant

04:19.370 --> 04:23.070
improvement to the cluster load balance.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.550
That's a significant improvement.

04:25.710 --> 04:33.230
If there are a smart overall they will not take any action if they have a high mean that will damage

04:33.230 --> 04:34.760
your environment.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.100
They do that.

04:36.110 --> 04:42.870
The press will take action and migrate the virtual machine to another Hulst for a safe environment.

04:42.980 --> 04:49.010
Then we have the number three by default Vicent instead of one would apply a recommendation that promised

04:49.080 --> 04:53.240
atlast good improvement to do cluster load balancing.

04:53.250 --> 04:59.480
Then the third one we apply a recommendation that is a moderate improvement.

04:59.480 --> 05:05.800
So I just love it overdo loading and the improvements of the load balance.

05:05.810 --> 05:12.080
Then we have the aggressive one that we would apply accommodation that Brahmin's even a slight improvement

05:12.080 --> 05:18.560
to the cluster loading if there are a small loading in a host automatically McGreal the virtual machine

05:18.560 --> 05:23.030
to another host even there are a slight improvement in New environments.

05:23.330 --> 05:29.840
So sometimes we need to use this one and something we need to use the aggressive one is in the region

05:29.900 --> 05:37.290
about environment and in your situation of course by time you buck right here and see which one will

05:37.330 --> 05:38.640
rise for your investments.

05:38.780 --> 05:46.220
For example if you have a poor hardware for example those old surveiled the top list that is used and

05:46.280 --> 05:54.200
as to how our low speed connection for example your environments have our low speed connection and a

05:54.200 --> 06:01.550
lot of virtual machine in your environment then if every time have a virtual machine migrated from a

06:01.550 --> 06:07.230
host to another host will slow down your network and slow down your environment.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.390
For that you need to use our conservative migration.

06:11.390 --> 06:19.370
But if you have a high speed connection powerful hardware etc. you need to use our aggressive migration

06:19.640 --> 06:22.750
to have a safe environment.

06:22.910 --> 06:26.460
All your controls do live in four or three.

06:26.630 --> 06:33.180
So for us I always prefer to use the aggressive one to harm our powerful environment.

06:33.320 --> 06:40.730
But of course you should take careful if you have for example some big virtual machine just virtual

06:40.730 --> 06:45.140
machine that's had for example three or four terabytes of data.

06:45.200 --> 06:53.800
You should try to of we using DNS because this will cool down your network and your environments.

06:53.800 --> 07:00.830
For example imagine our four terabytes over the top of our virtual machine migrated from that store

07:00.830 --> 07:02.090
to another store.

07:02.270 --> 07:08.170
Imagine how much time will take and your environment will be too slow etc..

07:08.180 --> 07:14.750
So for that it is always the germ of dirt there is for those virtual machine.

07:14.960 --> 07:23.990
And of course this option is available to exclude some virtual machine to not be used by DNS.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.730
So for that we won't use the aggressive one to see a rate environment.

07:28.850 --> 07:29.540
An example.
