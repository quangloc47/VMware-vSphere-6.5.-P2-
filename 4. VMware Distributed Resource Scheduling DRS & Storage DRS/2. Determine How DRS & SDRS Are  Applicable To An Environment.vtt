00:01.710 --> 00:02.460
Hello again.

00:02.630 --> 00:07.040
So let's get an idea about do there is distribute you the results.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.860
Skidder So what is difference.

00:10.970 --> 00:13.540
DEAN We're distributing the resource scheduler.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.730
The principal function of the dress is to automate resource allocation budget on C.P. and memory load.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.220
So the dress has no relation about DCP and the memory load.

00:27.220 --> 00:36.670
Staci that's mean you have for example in this example we had we have tree root we unable to Derrius

00:36.670 --> 00:43.790
inside this tree root that exists in the same cluster because the configuration of the rest of the label

00:43.810 --> 00:45.130
of the cluster.

00:45.130 --> 00:55.450
So the rest track start off all those so root in the same cluster and check the location of the resource

00:55.540 --> 00:57.520
into different tasks.

00:57.520 --> 01:06.390
And when any of those Haast have an overloading in a few and and the memory like in this example I had

01:06.720 --> 01:14.890
the server would have consumed about 100 percent of the city and the Memali That's me there is schul

01:14.890 --> 01:24.910
take action and minimise the overload in this host by negating the virtual machine one of those video

01:25.290 --> 01:30.320
DNS do its calculation Jannot which virtual machine should be migrated.

01:30.360 --> 01:38.820
The one that will give a free space of the superior and the only from that host is the motion if you

01:38.820 --> 01:45.420
remember that there is an illusion about the motion before into motion section.

01:45.510 --> 01:46.900
We do it manually for them.

01:46.950 --> 01:52.440
If we found this has to have an overloading on the CPO on the ramp we got to disappoint you the machine

01:52.620 --> 02:00.180
would click on it which would be great and then send it to another house that have less loading but

02:00.180 --> 02:07.470
no Deros while doing it automatically and take this virtual machine and chose Charles Dorise destination

02:07.850 --> 02:08.820
or right.

02:08.870 --> 02:13.380
That's when we get to do not vitrine the machine inside.

02:13.470 --> 02:20.510
And of course if you see this right here you see that this has to have only 20 percent of resource use

02:20.510 --> 02:20.890
it.

02:21.060 --> 02:31.830
And this physical set would have about 14 percent of the resource use it and logically you say does

02:31.860 --> 02:36.150
this one that have lots of free resources should guests.

02:36.200 --> 02:41.670
This new virtual machine so automatically derrieres will take this virtual machine will use the Wii

02:41.670 --> 02:46.060
motion to migrate it automatically and send it to the second.

02:46.070 --> 02:48.930
That's have more free of the resouce.

02:48.990 --> 02:54.290
Of course if you have another server that's have more features than this one.

02:54.330 --> 02:57.170
He will decide to take it to that server.

02:57.300 --> 03:03.080
And the same if something wrong happened to this house and have an overloading inside it.

03:03.220 --> 03:09.720
It will take action and take one of those between machine and the revolution then migrated to the physical

03:09.720 --> 03:15.150
server that had more free C.P and memory lock.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.680
So this is the idea of the press.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.380
See it's very simple.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.930
It is the emotion.

03:21.030 --> 03:29.050
It's more of do resource use it of the virtual machine from a host of overloading to another.

03:29.070 --> 03:32.850
That's how more free resource.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.130
And when I tell you that's the motion and not the emotion that's mean.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.870
Miguel is only the head of the virtual machine if remembered to hate.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.240
And nobody knows.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.570
We might get is the hate of the vitriol machine does mean rain.

03:47.640 --> 03:52.320
And do C.P. another kind of derrieres that we have.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.950
It's got to do storage.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.540
Did s just one I guess as the same as the motion and decide we're not going to be great.

04:01.550 --> 04:03.470
The heyday of the virtual machine.

04:03.690 --> 04:08.300
But we're going to degrade the body of the virtual machine.

04:08.370 --> 04:08.900
That's me.

04:09.030 --> 04:09.900
The virtual machine.

04:09.910 --> 04:20.670
Winsted using the same resouce of the physical host but the storage that will have a different action

04:20.930 --> 04:26.560
that's mean it will migrate the body from one to another slash.

04:26.760 --> 04:33.470
So as the same idea we have for example some virtual machines that have the body inside this shed its

04:33.490 --> 04:37.670
trash and that's why we need Atlas to us.

04:37.770 --> 04:43.980
So to have the storage there is we need to have at least two shedded.

04:44.010 --> 04:50.730
So if you have only one of those stores is it will not be available in your situation.

04:51.300 --> 04:58.140
And of course the recommended is to have more than 2 4 6 10 10 or more storage that's mean more hide's

04:58.230 --> 05:02.710
availability of the vitriol machine inside your environment.

05:02.730 --> 05:10.790
So in any case one of those virtual machine or our division machines that exist in this datastore right.

05:10.930 --> 05:19.340
This is a sheet it's a Lundvall in our example is our lunch number one start consuming do speed of do

05:21.070 --> 05:24.130
the inputs output do read and write.

05:24.200 --> 05:31.100
That's mean some virtual machine have hyped a lot of rhenium of the data from the disk.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.760
Some of them have to hide.

05:32.840 --> 05:41.240
Writing to me inputs and outputs like this because the heart but also have a our city and memory to

05:41.800 --> 05:46.610
random process that everybody in Mushin ask for it.

05:46.830 --> 05:54.240
Also if they have an over Claudian of the size for example the virtual machine can some more size of

05:54.240 --> 05:55.040
the store.

05:55.110 --> 06:00.510
So the free space in this shit storm has become less.

06:00.510 --> 06:05.590
For example 10 or 20 percent of the freeze thaw has available in this case.

06:06.950 --> 06:15.980
The press will take action and take one or two or three between the machine from this shit it's trash

06:16.370 --> 06:25.280
and use the storage emotion to greeds the storage of this machine to another shared stories that have

06:25.550 --> 06:32.720
more resources and have more space to host the new virtual machine.

06:32.720 --> 06:39.140
So this is the idea we have the DNS that's have information about the city and the memory.

06:39.150 --> 06:46.010
So it migrated to hate on the virtual machine from hosts that have overloading too has less law.

06:46.230 --> 06:53.570
Then we have to start Deros that migrates the body of the virtual machine from a shared storage to another

06:53.630 --> 06:56.380
shared storage but have more resouce.

06:56.750 --> 07:02.220
So this is a different dress that we have in the gym where we sit.

07:02.300 --> 07:09.090
So next we'll see some room that we can use it do depress and so large.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.250
It soon to be.
