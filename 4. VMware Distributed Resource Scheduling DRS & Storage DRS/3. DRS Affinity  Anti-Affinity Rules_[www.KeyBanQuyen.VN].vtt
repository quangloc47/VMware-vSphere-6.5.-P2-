Blogging so after discovering what the derrieres and the storage areas do and you know that's the details

00:07.580 --> 00:15.360
and to start a serious work automatically that's mean he is demotion automatically without needing to

00:15.360 --> 00:20.380
do anything by making it our country to know best.

00:20.490 --> 00:21.820
Should he do.

00:21.850 --> 00:30.800
No we have some rules that we need to apply to avoid some problem for our environment or for our cluster.

00:31.470 --> 00:40.110
But through callid affinity and Antti affinity rule in some cases for example in virtual machine in

00:40.170 --> 00:51.620
our Santer we create for example by scene in different Tulse but in some condition we need to use two

00:51.860 --> 00:59.360
server machine to virtual machine for example of the same root in a separate hosts.

00:59.450 --> 01:08.290
For some reason for example let's start with the VM TVM on the iPhone.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.200
That's me rant DMD's on different tasks.

01:11.210 --> 01:11.920
That's me.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.910
We have a virtual machine a virtual machine.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.000
B We need to run them in different tasks.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.280
In any case this virtual machine should not run into same hosts.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.190
Why.

01:23.190 --> 01:26.340
For example we have an exchange server.

01:26.610 --> 01:33.840
When we create in our company an Exchange server for the security reason we need to have atlast to exchange

01:33.840 --> 01:40.530
server jewel case server that work together for a security reason that's something wrong happened to

01:40.530 --> 01:49.860
the case number one the Case number two should keep running to avoid losing our work or our server in

01:49.980 --> 01:56.280
some specific company imagine that the big company that have a server that's do its own job drove the

01:56.280 --> 01:59.690
Server Exchange and the server exchange tickets.

01:59.690 --> 02:07.530
Now imagine how many they were lost when the Server Exchange is out of service for at least one hour

02:07.560 --> 02:08.250
or two.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.050
How so for security reasons.

02:11.190 --> 02:17.980
It is always necessary to use atlast to exchange route as a day's work for them.

02:17.990 --> 02:19.360
Want to try it.

02:19.500 --> 02:26.270
But let's make it simple and it only two days served to make the idea more clear.

02:26.280 --> 02:35.310
So for that we need to go to the server or the number or the case server one in a host and another case

02:35.400 --> 02:36.260
server.

02:36.480 --> 02:43.320
The second one in a second does for security reason for example the hosts one have some problem.

02:43.320 --> 02:49.060
For example it's data or it's damaged or it's is of.

02:49.130 --> 02:55.200
So the company kept using Case number two from the host non-virtual.

02:55.370 --> 02:55.870
That's me.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.930
We still have connection to do still work.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.550
So my server will be always available in that condition.

03:04.370 --> 03:15.030
Two of we having Duke case 1 and case all in the same host we need to get some afine to run it on afine

03:15.760 --> 03:23.140
that's mean the affinity it's to make them at the same host the affinity is to make them into separate

03:23.350 --> 03:27.610
hosts to run due to VMC all different host.

03:27.820 --> 03:32.270
So we had our affinity group in the Live at MTV.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.010
That's I mean a virtual machine to have it you see in different house.

03:36.010 --> 03:42.960
So in any case of course this example I have only to host but just to get the idea in the right environment

03:43.000 --> 03:50.480
would have 10 20 hosts and there as will keep negotiating virtual machine from host to host for some

03:50.530 --> 03:52.380
specific reason of the resource.

03:52.380 --> 03:59.660
Then the next day he needs your machine beat on the host talked on the host 5 and then after a week

03:59.670 --> 04:04.420
see that the virtual machine should be migrated from housewives to host one.

04:04.470 --> 04:12.420
And in that case when we created the vitriol machine B that is the case server number two of the exchange

04:12.830 --> 04:20.240
on the Housewives has one note we have the virtual machine and the virtual machine be in the same host.

04:20.430 --> 04:28.000
And we have a dungeon situation that's mean if something wrong happened to this host We're going to

04:28.010 --> 04:32.070
lost our mail server in our company.

04:32.290 --> 04:40.400
So we're up Oh Auntie up in each room and we tell to do their s configuration please.

04:40.420 --> 04:45.740
The Virtual Machine Age and virtual machine should never be in the same house.

04:45.910 --> 04:52.660
So you're automatically keep a rule in his man and every time when he wants to migrate and virtual machine

04:52.730 --> 05:00.040
AI or the virtual machine he will check that different server available and always migrate the virtual

05:00.040 --> 05:03.990
machine to our host and the virtual machine.

05:04.090 --> 05:10.030
To a lot of different hosts and who never use them together in the same host.

05:10.270 --> 05:16.960
This is the idea of the only affinity and the same idea for affinity that's me around Aranda Wii games

05:16.960 --> 05:18.810
on the same hostes.

05:18.820 --> 05:25.190
That's me always around the virtual machine and the virtual machine be in the same Haast.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.230
How so.

05:26.260 --> 05:30.550
For example we have our shaded point connected to our database.

05:30.550 --> 05:36.250
So for example this virtual machine about the shared point and this virtual machine for the database

05:36.340 --> 05:39.700
that's server shared point.

05:39.830 --> 05:47.870
For example just an example in our environment we use the one gigabyte file duplex network adapter to

05:47.870 --> 05:49.630
connect it to different tasks.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.690
But as we know the vitriol network adapter inside the different tasks.

05:55.790 --> 06:03.200
How did gigabytes of speed that mean the connection between the difference between the machine inside

06:03.200 --> 06:12.560
the same host is 10 gigabytes of speed but the connection between virtual machine from the host to another

06:12.560 --> 06:18.550
virtual machine inside another host is limited by one gigabyte for leaks.

06:19.100 --> 06:27.860
So this is just an example of why we need to virtual machine in the same hosts for a reason.

06:27.860 --> 06:34.790
Of course there are lots of situations but I don't have any idea right now about why we need to run

06:34.890 --> 06:36.620
to video in on the same host.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.540
But this is just an example.

06:38.780 --> 06:47.810
So to get to the benefits of using change gigabytes fald a place that's exist inside the vitriol switch

06:47.930 --> 06:49.760
and the virtual network adapter.

06:49.910 --> 06:55.200
We need to always run this virtual machine inside the same host.

06:55.250 --> 07:02.930
So for that we could use a VM to VM opportunity that's me run VM on the same host and we are that does

07:03.020 --> 07:04.910
the virtual machine.

07:05.210 --> 07:10.700
That's mean for example for the shedded point and the virtual machine B for the database offered to

07:10.730 --> 07:11.110
share it.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.980
One should always run in the same host.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.920
So in any case data is need to migrate the Vitruvian machine he automatically will agree to vidual machine.

07:26.060 --> 07:31.420
We did the affinity this virtual machine bit to vitriol machine a.

07:31.670 --> 07:41.000
It will take them both off this machine and migrating them to another house that can support this virtual

07:41.000 --> 07:42.100
machine.

07:42.110 --> 07:49.250
So this is the idea of affinity and affinity it rule out delivery of the fee to VM.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.440
So the next video for more rules.
