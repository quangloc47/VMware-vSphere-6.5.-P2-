00:00.510 --> 00:01.330
Hello again.

00:01.380 --> 00:08.350
So let's get some rule about two clusters that we can use with DNS.

00:08.580 --> 00:18.040
So if we back right here try to check for example Isak's I one have to machine do Windows 7 and Windows

00:18.070 --> 00:18.530
XP.

00:18.550 --> 00:23.040
Number for the E6 I do have one machine that is x.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.270
I have two machine.

00:25.390 --> 00:30.400
So we want to work on this machine and make some affinity route.

00:30.490 --> 00:38.000
So we're back to that cluster of course not in the respect there is we need to go down and in the configuration

00:38.050 --> 00:42.540
we have some new configuration that we can use with the dentist.

00:42.640 --> 00:53.120
So V.M. where EVC VM hosts group and VM host rule and VM override we're going to see them one by one.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.570
So the VM host group needs some host.

00:55.570 --> 00:59.770
We're going to see it and we have a VM host rules.

00:59.770 --> 01:03.240
If you remember we talk about to do this route.

01:03.490 --> 01:09.960
So in the VM host room we can add to rule that we want to use in our cluster.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.960
So we click on it and here we give it a name.

01:13.960 --> 01:23.920
For example we want to create a router Sipah rate DMH when it is on XP.

01:23.930 --> 01:30.180
Number four jewel when seven like that.

01:30.360 --> 01:37.210
And then we need to enable this one this enable and disable us I mean when you apply this rule.

01:37.320 --> 01:43.530
And one day you just take to disable this rule and you want the cluster to ignore this rule you simply

01:43.770 --> 01:45.100
check this one right.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.960
And this rule are not going to work into.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.940
There is then when you want to do it you simply enable it.

01:52.200 --> 01:57.730
So we have different type of option to trolls drop the VM host route.

01:57.870 --> 02:00.690
The first one is keep the virtual machine together.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.450
This is due affinity.

02:02.620 --> 02:10.250
Lets mean this two bedroom machine should work at the same Haast we have separate virtual machine that's

02:10.270 --> 02:12.780
made into affinity.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.110
That's me in the two virtual machine should work in the different Tulse should never be hosted in the

02:19.110 --> 02:21.230
same Isak's I host.

02:21.330 --> 02:24.850
Then we have some virtual machine to host but need some group.

02:24.870 --> 02:30.730
We're going to see it later then virtual machine to virtual machine that need also some group.

02:30.860 --> 02:34.200
We're going to do different tasks and group in this option.

02:34.210 --> 02:34.950
Right.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.610
So we chose for example separate virtual machines and we want to separate two virtual machines to not

02:41.940 --> 02:43.720
run in the same process.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.930
So we simply click out and here of course you can use the first Patricias search.

02:48.930 --> 02:55.710
For example when ex-Beatle gets all the machine that's callet win XP or any machine that you want.

02:55.710 --> 03:01.310
But in our situation we're going to use the different VM that we have.

03:01.390 --> 03:09.220
So if we click on this one like that to get the order by E6 I host and we see that E6 I host an android.

03:09.260 --> 03:22.420
How do we explain that before and when 7 is X i.e. to have Win XP 5 is x 3 1/2 Win XP 6 and we center

03:22.500 --> 03:23.300
server.

03:23.950 --> 03:30.820
Of course we're not going to touch these windows because this is the center and we don't want to migrate

03:30.820 --> 03:39.750
it to any other host because if I want to have only 4G gobshites and only is Atri how about 12 gigabytes.

03:40.420 --> 03:44.360
So we chose for example this one that exists in the same house.

03:44.410 --> 03:50.390
So the room that we want to practice the machine should not be at the same house.

03:50.410 --> 03:53.110
So Windows 7 and Windows XP.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.330
Number four.

03:54.580 --> 03:55.710
So we click OK.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.170
No we have two machine that should not run into same host.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.530
Of course you can.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.280
I'm not a machine that's mean.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.930
It's your machine should not never run in the same house.

04:07.060 --> 04:07.700
That's me.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.610
It should be guaranteed to default on toast.

04:11.740 --> 04:18.550
So now we have a machines and when we click OK of course it will take a little time and we'll start

04:18.550 --> 04:21.520
migrating one of those virtual machines.

04:21.670 --> 04:28.900
After doing its own calculation and decided which one can be migrated from the hosts Isak's I wan to

04:29.130 --> 04:31.900
a specific code that can get this one.

04:32.170 --> 04:40.750
So Windows XP not before and do Windows 7 should not run in the same E6 I host as you said the migration

04:40.990 --> 04:42.570
start perfectly.

04:42.580 --> 04:48.630
If we click on it it will give you a task of beginning to get your machine and begin eating them.

04:48.670 --> 04:53.470
Windows 7 is I one last one in Morocco to E6.

04:53.470 --> 05:03.070
I do love want in Morocco with encryption Negrete VM Windows 7 of host is I want in Morocco.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.980
So its worked perfectly this route.

05:05.980 --> 05:11.500
Of course you see the statue right hand is enabled if you want to disable it then to call police if

05:11.500 --> 05:13.400
you have any real conflict.

05:13.400 --> 05:20.610
Thats me an example you see that this machine should never run at the same host with this machine can

05:20.810 --> 05:26.740
you you add under the rules that have a conflict with this rule for example you say that this machine

05:26.890 --> 05:29.900
should run always with this machine in the same way.

05:30.070 --> 05:34.270
So we have a complete right there and this will give you a massage.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.000
And this rule will not be going to work.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.670
So its no do rule its work perfectly.

05:41.170 --> 05:41.740
So the same.

05:41.740 --> 05:52.040
Also we have a kind of another rule for example afine t rule like that then we use good virtual machine

05:52.050 --> 05:53.400
together with click.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.230
And then you choose the machine that should run together.

05:57.240 --> 06:04.380
Of course in this case if we chose the Windows 7 and Windows 4 to run in the same host this will be

06:04.470 --> 06:05.500
a conflict.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.090
Give it an example.

06:07.370 --> 06:08.430
OK.

06:08.850 --> 06:13.210
So the direct route is in conflict with existing irresolute in the cluster.

06:13.220 --> 06:19.310
It will be desirable the rule can be enabling manually when the conflict are resolved.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.070
So it's automatically disabled.

06:21.130 --> 06:25.110
We can click OK and you will see it right there but it's disabled.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.670
You see it this way.

06:26.760 --> 06:31.180
And we have this other missiles that we have some conflict between them.

06:31.260 --> 06:37.270
So we simply delete this one because it's have a conflict with another route.

06:38.040 --> 06:49.140
So if we check the windows 7 no Windows 7 around is x i house number two also we can try to add some

06:49.320 --> 06:50.160
other option.

06:50.160 --> 06:56.390
For example do a Windows XP number five and Windows XP.

06:56.390 --> 06:58.640
Number four should run into same host.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.870
So we now number five existing is Isak's I too.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.470
And number four exist in is X I number one.

07:05.630 --> 07:06.720
So we click OK.

07:06.830 --> 07:20.030
Of course here we need to add our feet Niti to the XP 4 and XP 5 like that.

07:20.310 --> 07:24.770
They keep the virtual machine together with click OK.

07:25.210 --> 07:32.140
So the rule does not have any conflicts and automatically you will see that the virtual machine five

07:32.350 --> 07:40.260
or virtual machine four will be migrated to do hosts that will going to work perfectly.

07:40.810 --> 07:42.950
Of course what it will is the tablet rule.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.420
So for example the windows force will never run in with Windows 7.

07:48.610 --> 07:51.450
So that's just the Windows 7.

07:51.460 --> 07:58.180
We're not going to migrate to this Windows XP for to the halls that have Windows 7.

07:58.180 --> 08:09.020
So automatically I would chose do win xp 5 to be migrated to one of the other horse would just give

08:09.020 --> 08:12.030
it a little time and we'll see the rule.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.640
Also we take enable.

08:15.690 --> 08:19.140
So this is the different root of unity and happiness.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.500
And of course we have some other rule.

08:21.590 --> 08:25.050
We're going to see it in the next video to see on the next video.
