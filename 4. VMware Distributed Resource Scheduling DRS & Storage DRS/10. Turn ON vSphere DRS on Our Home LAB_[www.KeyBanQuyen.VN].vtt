00:00.630 --> 00:01.240
Blogging.

00:01.350 --> 00:02.690
So let's give up.

00:02.700 --> 00:05.850
There's a difference in our luck.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.540
So we eat it.

00:07.590 --> 00:12.920
Dearest and reach your own fit Dennis.

00:13.250 --> 00:22.460
Of course we chose fully automated and we give it aggressive to see a live show in our example so we

00:22.460 --> 00:23.790
click OK.

00:24.080 --> 00:31.530
No the difference is enable in our dues Isak's I host in this cluster.

00:32.570 --> 00:40.970
So if we walk to do Samari and try to see the overloading of the different toasts.

00:41.030 --> 00:47.330
So for example Doha's Twan have a Windows XP bar on it.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.440
Check this one.

00:48.440 --> 00:54.350
Mike Datsik consume about 15 percent of the C.P. and 50 percent of the memory.

00:55.190 --> 01:04.300
Then do Isak's I Hulst number two also as the same as is I want of course E6 I treat the Vicent that

01:04.470 --> 01:09.050
you have a height of consumption and it can't migrate.

01:09.070 --> 01:15.350
Do When center from this host to any of those other hosts because there is not space available for it.

01:15.860 --> 01:20.710
So we are going to concentrate on the E-6 I want and Isak's I too.

01:20.870 --> 01:31.090
So we see that we have a similar consumption of two resouce and we have the virtual machine bolted on

01:31.300 --> 01:37.560
in the Isak's I one and then another Windows XP ported on in the E6 item.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.780
So we have some equalitie into reshoots.

01:42.130 --> 01:50.380
If we try to get overloaded in the House number one by powering on our windows machine inside.

01:50.530 --> 01:57.850
So for example this when 7 does exist India is X I want and try to power on this machine.

01:58.170 --> 02:10.060
You will see that we have an overload in India is X I want then I to so I want start onstream mid-morning

02:10.290 --> 02:11.090
and.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.960
D6 I to constant.

02:13.980 --> 02:25.340
Also some reduced so Windows 7 is port on its just give it a little time so the rest stop working.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.220
So you see right there different users

02:39.010 --> 02:43.420
OK lets just give it a little time into the dress to look drop

02:51.590 --> 03:00.660
so D6 I one start consuming more C-p and less Aufforderung.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.780
You should see some dress function start

03:11.400 --> 03:13.630
it is mighty optimally to

03:17.450 --> 03:19.480
this push hand to do it.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.090
For example we got to this virtual machine and try power it off this one.

03:25.090 --> 03:30.070
So you get three resource from this host like that.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.130
Yes.

03:32.410 --> 03:43.290
And we should see different reasonless loading this Holst's.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.390
So how does it start migrating to Windows 7.

03:47.530 --> 03:50.680
Let's see the migration Stodger

03:56.590 --> 03:59.790
so hot migration windows important is excite.

03:59.900 --> 04:08.200
One in Morocco G-6 I to land one in Morakot with encryption tusk migration Vetri machine.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.110
So it started migrating to Windows 7 from 2 6.

04:12.120 --> 04:17.410
I want to E-6 I threw in the same lands without any need change.

04:17.610 --> 04:26.330
So this is our real example of migrating our virtual machine from house to another host.

04:26.360 --> 04:33.100
So I do it on calculation and decide which one should be migrated from this host to another host.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.190
So soon the next.
