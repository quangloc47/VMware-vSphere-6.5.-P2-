Blogging so after seeing the is or commission and different option we have then we have some additional

00:09.660 --> 00:14.890
option for a dentist confutation let's just cover them one by one.

00:15.030 --> 00:21.730
So the distribution distribution of the vitriol machine across the different costs.

00:22.020 --> 00:29.160
So if we take this option for availability distributes a more even number of vitriol Mushin across Haast

00:29.880 --> 00:32.660
this option meaning does the data.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.580
We'll distribute it to your machine to be almost equally between two different hosts.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.360
So for example if you have five hosts and one hundred machines.

00:45.540 --> 00:52.390
So the defense will try to distribute about 20 virtual machine for each of the hosts if you need to

00:52.390 --> 01:01.470
migrate to vitrine from a host want to host to he will automatically try to get our Another video machine

01:01.500 --> 01:08.640
from CG to host that tab list resouce loading and migrate back to the host number one.

01:08.790 --> 01:15.270
So the total will be 20 virtual machine and the host number one and 20 virtual machine in the house

01:15.360 --> 01:17.910
number two and so on and so on.

01:17.910 --> 01:24.870
Of course it should not be equal for 100 percent but it's about nineteen ninety five percent of the

01:24.870 --> 01:27.680
vitrine machine should be equal into different toss.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.360
For example 10 11 or 20 21 etc..

01:32.700 --> 01:39.180
So this is the option that you need for any reason you can enable this one to have the same number of

01:39.180 --> 01:41.940
the virtual machine across different tasks.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.370
Of course in our example we are not going to use it then we have the memory metric for load balancing.

01:49.470 --> 01:56.690
This is the second option for us to calculate the load buttons on the different toasts.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.690
Information about do memory consumption.

02:02.150 --> 02:09.270
So load balanced budget or Qasimi memory of virtual machine rather than active memory.

02:09.380 --> 02:13.640
If you remember when we create a host that how far she.

02:13.880 --> 02:19.350
And then we create a machine we can give this machine about six gigabytes of RAM.

02:19.640 --> 02:26.780
But in the right environment this machine does not cost you all six gigabytes of time.

02:27.240 --> 02:32.200
Also for example we have two machine with 4G gobshites and the second one.

02:32.210 --> 02:39.290
We 4G bite into same host and that host only have the 4G gobshites both the two virtual machine will

02:39.290 --> 02:48.200
go into work because they do not consume the fall for DECONCINI only about one you go by the cigarette

02:48.200 --> 02:50.420
machine and also consume one gigabyte.

02:50.420 --> 02:57.680
So we have the consumer with only two gigabytes of the house and we have two gigabytes free if we chose.

02:57.700 --> 03:06.070
Load balanced budget on our cost me more of that your machine lets me load the bongs due the RAM give

03:06.070 --> 03:10.040
it is vitriol machine and you see are a lot more solid.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.470
This is only recommended for cluster with a host.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.920
Memory is not over committed that's me.

03:18.310 --> 03:26.020
If all that thought of the virtual machine in the same house that you configured the city of Washington

03:26.050 --> 03:30.190
and give it a specific run how to top that off.

03:30.340 --> 03:38.960
On Sumeet Memali in does but you should not committed the frame of the host.

03:39.280 --> 03:46.230
In for example here if we give a virtual machine 16 gigabytes and the host have only eight gigabytes.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.920
This option we are not going to work for you because it is illogical.

03:51.430 --> 03:58.360
When he see that a virtual machine can stream 16 gigabytes and the hosts only have 8.

03:58.410 --> 04:07.060
Why is it remote going to migrate this virtual machine for a host that does not have at least 16 gigabytes

04:07.120 --> 04:10.210
and this will give you a neuron in your environment.

04:10.210 --> 04:16.920
So this is we'll going to use it if you have more rain in your house and you don't have a problem off

04:16.930 --> 04:17.960
the memory.

04:18.160 --> 04:24.850
Then you can enable this one so just to get an idea about the memory metric for load balancing and then

04:24.850 --> 04:27.520
we have do you overcommitted.

04:27.520 --> 04:33.110
Of course we need to disable this one city overcommitted is the same as memory.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.550
We control Seip you overcommitment in the cluster.

04:36.730 --> 04:46.870
So if you give two machine you stink and the total of those C.P of those machine is more than the speed

04:46.930 --> 04:48.200
of the host.

04:48.340 --> 04:54.550
Then the press will take action and migrate one of those virtual machine to another host that have free

04:54.760 --> 05:02.440
speech that can support this virtual machine so you can check it overcommitted and your tools do a percentage

05:02.470 --> 05:04.950
of the sleepy over commitment.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.830
So this is the idea about some other option.

05:08.050 --> 05:14.520
Then we have the power management option and it's all up to this one.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.740
Then we check power management.
