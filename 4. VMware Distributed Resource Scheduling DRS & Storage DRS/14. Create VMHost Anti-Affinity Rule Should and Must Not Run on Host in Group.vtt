00:02.050 --> 00:02.870
Hello again.

00:02.920 --> 00:06.780
So let's get some hosts and V.M. group.

00:06.790 --> 00:11.730
So for that we need to create some hosts and some V.M. group.

00:11.770 --> 00:21.960
So a click up and here we give it a name for example Holst's group one like that you give it any name

00:21.990 --> 00:22.550
that you want.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.930
We want to work at the level of the hosts so we choose Hulst and we click up.

00:28.140 --> 00:30.820
They show us all the different tools available.

00:31.170 --> 00:36.470
So for example we want to chose some specific calls that we want to work on.

00:36.570 --> 00:42.900
Of course in the right environment you will have a lot of E6 I host but in our situation we have only

00:42.990 --> 00:43.600
three.

00:43.620 --> 00:48.240
So for example we chose number one and we click OK.

00:48.330 --> 00:52.030
One example this hostile group number one that's content is x.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.100
I host but what.

00:53.430 --> 01:00.410
But in redevelopments For example we have five or six I hopped into number one and another 10 E-6 I

01:00.420 --> 01:06.660
Holst's in another group number two we're going to explain the idea later.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.920
So we at the HAUST group.

01:12.110 --> 01:16.550
So we've created the group it is it last group.

01:16.570 --> 01:19.060
And the difference is right inside this house.

01:19.300 --> 01:20.820
Then we add a group.

01:20.860 --> 01:30.450
For example do V.M. group 1 and then we choose to leave it up to them we click and then we choose a

01:30.450 --> 01:32.360
different.

01:32.670 --> 01:40.960
So when we chose the ethics I want we need to try to pick up some virtual machine.

01:40.990 --> 01:45.650
For example this one and this one like that.

01:46.030 --> 01:54.810
So to do some role of two DNS so we click OK that's me in the VM group have two Windows virtual machine

01:55.190 --> 01:58.130
Windows XP and basics and two windows 7.

01:58.450 --> 02:02.420
So we click OK that's of this machine.

02:02.420 --> 02:12.510
So we'll see it work like into the environment then we're back to do is X.

02:13.030 --> 02:21.030
And here we have no VM group and then we back to do VM host Group.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.310
So to avoid some conflict I will going to delete.

02:27.400 --> 02:27.870
Rule.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.290
I will go into the latest route to avoid any conflict in the near one.

02:33.300 --> 02:39.840
Then we click up and here we chose a virtual machine to Haast.

02:40.090 --> 02:44.920
And how do you see that we have VM group available of course if we have talked to the group about the

02:44.920 --> 02:47.250
virtual machine we see them right.

02:47.470 --> 02:58.780
They do Hulst group why we need to use do virtual machine costs also in a real environment for the height

02:58.810 --> 03:06.250
of mobility as we clearly are that we need to wait around in a virtual machine for example to Case 1

03:06.280 --> 03:11.840
and 2 of the exchange in the same service to avoid losing the server.

03:12.070 --> 03:19.290
In any case thats something wrong coupled to that E6 I host also we have some Hostia group.

03:19.300 --> 03:26.670
For example lets get this design right hate for results but in an environment we have a of and started

03:26.680 --> 03:38.650
in Iraq ARAC like do arm want that's how to five six or seven server inside it and managed by one power

03:38.860 --> 03:43.670
cable and one clean etc. so do rock.

03:43.750 --> 03:51.070
We have for example in a situation that have to rig or imagine but this is our room 1 and this is our

03:51.070 --> 03:52.650
room too.

03:53.140 --> 03:58.320
So in the break number one we have for example the server one server.

03:58.530 --> 04:05.310
I tree and the rock number 2 2 6 4 6 5 and 6 6.

04:05.590 --> 04:15.060
So when we see that the virtual machine thats this one like that for example the virtual machine that

04:15.060 --> 04:23.820
hard case number one should always separated from do case number two let's me this virtual machine number

04:23.820 --> 04:32.790
two like that if we put them inside the same host then we have a dangerous situation if something wrong

04:32.830 --> 04:33.820
happened to this.

04:33.900 --> 04:42.690
He asks I host the company we lost the connection to the Exchange server from the case 1 and Case 2.

04:42.820 --> 04:53.550
So we had a rule that always always make the case one and do it in separate E-6 I host that's mean or

04:53.550 --> 04:53.760
not.

04:53.770 --> 04:54.890
This one right hand.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.130
And the second one in another house.

04:57.130 --> 05:06.850
So if something wrong happen to this U-6 I host do gays do still work perfectly in this server but in

05:07.600 --> 05:16.150
some company in another situation we have RAC number one and the rock number two does track have different

05:16.150 --> 05:18.360
server on stolid inside.

05:18.640 --> 05:27.910
And for example if something wrong Koppen to do rock number one to cable that give the power to a different

05:27.910 --> 05:34.370
server in this truck take it down for example something wrong Carpenter this rock.

05:34.390 --> 05:38.670
So in this situation we lost the ears I won.

05:38.790 --> 05:45.330
That is I treat and this double Isak's I have do exchange server.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.940
The kids want to talk in this situation.

05:48.990 --> 05:58.130
Also we lost the connection to exchange route and we are in bad situation in our company.

05:58.380 --> 06:02.910
So another rule that we do is do the house.

06:03.150 --> 06:09.750
If you remember in the DNS we perused the VM VM that's me route between this virtual machine to dismiss

06:09.750 --> 06:10.390
your machine.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.290
No we need to add a VM to a house that's me.

06:14.310 --> 06:15.180
We are.

06:15.180 --> 06:18.600
Why is D-Rays Liverpool to.

06:18.890 --> 06:20.340
Virtual Machine of the case.

06:20.340 --> 06:25.860
Do in any of the server of the track number one always put it in a different rack.

06:25.860 --> 06:28.150
For example in rock number two.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.450
Or a rock number three etc..

06:30.600 --> 06:32.250
That's me in any situation.

06:32.270 --> 06:39.800
Did s need to migrate some virtual machine and decided to migrate this one from this host.

06:40.130 --> 06:46.680
Host number four that exist Interac number two of which to boot is in the rack number one and it will

06:46.680 --> 06:54.830
be easy to track number three or rack number for it at all or any of those other ESX that exist in the

06:54.840 --> 06:55.170
rack.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.860
Number two like that.

06:56.910 --> 07:02.910
So this is the root of the VM to host.

07:02.930 --> 07:09.500
So imagine this as the same as in a room for example you have some server in our room one and another

07:09.500 --> 07:11.340
server in our room number two.

07:11.450 --> 07:18.950
If something wrong happened to this rule for example a catastrophe or something in attack or a fire

07:18.950 --> 07:24.750
in this room you still have to sit in a room that have your virtual machine work perfectly.

07:25.070 --> 07:30.490
So this is the idea of the group through a host Group.

07:30.500 --> 07:41.750
So in the host group number one we Isak's I want and I do and E6 I treat their individual machine that

07:41.750 --> 07:47.320
we want them to be running into RAC number what we added in the group.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.740
Then we added case number to the database.

07:50.740 --> 08:00.170
Number two the server number two etc in the VM group and then we give it up rule that it should not

08:00.530 --> 08:02.180
run in the host Group.

08:02.180 --> 08:02.850
That's me.

08:02.990 --> 08:09.800
The virtual machine that exists in this group should not run into group number one.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.260
That's me.

08:10.280 --> 08:17.210
In this case number two should not run into rock number one that's Hovda difference is I host.
