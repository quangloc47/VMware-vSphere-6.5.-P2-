WEBVTT

00:01.180 --> 00:02.470
But how do you see that we have.

00:02.490 --> 00:05.550
Sure multi-brand all should run.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.320
That's me.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.630
When we are should not right that's me.

00:09.650 --> 00:13.600
This case will not run in rock number one.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.260
We can also.

00:15.400 --> 00:22.890
Charles rot in the host group then we created a group called Rock number two.

00:22.950 --> 00:25.190
Then we took this case.

00:25.260 --> 00:32.880
Shawled always ran into a rock number two and the same food kids want the children in rock.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.880
Number one of course you need to get an idea about the different rules that we're going to use and know

00:39.410 --> 00:46.080
which one should be the perfect and two small configuration that will work perfectly.

00:46.080 --> 00:55.820
So also we have Schrute and musts so virtual machine intergroup what should or must.

00:56.010 --> 01:01.660
What's the difference between truly and musts virtual machine that that's a member of the VM group.

01:01.710 --> 01:03.960
Should that run on the host Group.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.580
That's college group 1 and then we have.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.700
Must mean must run.

01:09.780 --> 01:19.470
The difference between truly and must is that when we say that case number one should run into Group

01:19.860 --> 01:20.240
1.

01:20.250 --> 01:25.250
The top 2 E6 I want and E-6 I 2 and 6 I treat that's me.

01:25.380 --> 01:35.360
If something wrong happened to do Haast it's like that for example is X I won tickets done.

01:35.400 --> 01:43.430
This machine will be migrated to a house number two or number three.

01:43.430 --> 01:50.370
Also if something wrong happen to do E-6 i.e. number 3 it will be idea to do Holst's and virtual and

01:50.370 --> 01:51.530
so on and so on.

01:51.690 --> 02:02.830
But in case stats do fall rock tickets don't like that this rock tickets are dumb and out of cities

02:02.870 --> 02:05.570
all those years I was out of service.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.420
In this case when we chose shawled that's mean.

02:09.530 --> 02:17.810
It is recommended to run this virtual machine in the rack number one group of the hostages br1 But in

02:17.810 --> 02:26.300
this situation you can McGinty's this virtual machine from the rack number 1 to rack number 2 or any

02:26.360 --> 02:27.150
rack available.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.760
If you have for example track number 3 it will go to do it in a bit rich of way.

02:31.970 --> 02:36.840
Having them in the same group but as we chose.

02:36.870 --> 02:44.650
She told me we still are able to run this virtual machine in the rack number.

02:45.320 --> 02:52.550
So we will keep our machine working perfectly without any problem when we chose short but in any case

02:52.640 --> 03:03.860
when we choose must when we chose must mean this machine must run into rack number one and if something

03:03.860 --> 03:11.310
wrong happened to rack number one that's mean all the server in rack number 1 out of service don't McGary

03:11.360 --> 03:12.080
this machine.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.320
This virtual machine will be out of service.

03:16.610 --> 03:22.080
It will be out of service into this Iraq gets voted on.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.030
Or get back to the life.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.790
So this machine will be date.

03:25.790 --> 03:33.590
When do rock or a group of the hosts date the machine will be out of service and the company will keep

03:33.590 --> 03:37.300
using two other cases.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.790
Number two it's Intel.

03:39.230 --> 03:45.700
So this is the difference between must and choose to say must run and must not run.

03:45.710 --> 03:46.410
That's me.

03:46.580 --> 03:50.370
If we chose must not run the group in a better one.

03:50.660 --> 03:58.580
So for example this machine that ran into rock number one and something wrong happened to this rock.

03:58.580 --> 04:05.570
It will migrated to another host that does not exist in the group number one.

04:05.640 --> 04:14.450
If then the other hosts like that the other hosts have something wrong again.

04:16.460 --> 04:19.580
Like that this ARAC I can take it down.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.270
Then he try to migrate this machine to another host.

04:24.470 --> 04:32.730
But when he can't find unavailable Haast only does one that exist in the group one that must not run

04:32.750 --> 04:33.440
in it.

04:33.470 --> 04:39.460
Then this machine will be out of service until one of the different hosts.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.450
That does not exist in the group.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.290
One will be available.

04:43.360 --> 04:48.070
Then he will migrate this machine traits and I it on again.

04:48.470 --> 04:54.800
So this is the idea of should and must and will rant and should not read.

04:55.370 --> 05:03.760
So in my situation we choose VM group one that top the tree or machine number one end to Hulst group

05:05.010 --> 05:06.890
the top E-6 I.

05:07.170 --> 05:14.780
That's mean we want to run this virtual machine to show the rat or the trolls.

05:14.810 --> 05:20.980
Mustard and Mc Do a cluster action quickly so we give it this idea Itek.

05:21.320 --> 05:29.450
If we back itat and try to remember we should rule for example the House is E-6 I want the virtual machine

05:29.660 --> 05:40.970
is Windows XP and Windows 7 should run Windows 7 exist in D6 I joked and we want this virtual machine

05:40.970 --> 05:44.320
to run into Group 1.

05:44.370 --> 05:49.650
The top Isak's I one lets me distort Vitry machine will be migrated from.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.310
I too and expatriate to ESX one.

05:53.440 --> 06:06.280
So if we back to our route then we chose DMH to use x y one like that that's mean to virtual machine

06:06.850 --> 06:09.720
will be migrated to do you.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.580
I want virtual machine to host them.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.710
Group 1 to host Group month must run.

06:15.910 --> 06:17.150
So we click OK.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.170
No you will see a new road.

06:22.570 --> 06:29.780
Or is it that it will take time to start migrating the virtual machine from different difference is

06:29.930 --> 06:33.050
I do I one of the group number one

06:38.270 --> 06:42.230
does it no it start migrating to Windows 7.

06:42.440 --> 06:51.360
If you click on Nate the task migrate between machine migrating them seven virtual machine Windows 7

06:51.700 --> 06:53.520
from 6 2.

06:53.570 --> 06:57.190
I want and the resource pool cluster in Morocco.

07:02.490 --> 07:11.040
So hard migrating Windows 7 from E-6 I taught land one in Morocco six I want land one in Morocco.

07:17.670 --> 07:23.300
So after finishing this migration it will start the second one.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.140
Windows XP.

07:25.170 --> 07:28.280
So let's give us a little time and see what would happen.

07:30.640 --> 07:37.680
So of course when you create your route you need to make a logical road try to avoid any conflict.

07:37.680 --> 07:43.160
Of course when you do a conflict you would see a missile or a tear but you have a conflict between Rule

07:43.650 --> 07:46.970
for example shows that this machine must run in it.

07:47.030 --> 07:52.530
I want then you create another rule and shows that this machine must run into it.

07:52.580 --> 07:53.360
I do.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.120
Then you have a conflict.

07:55.140 --> 08:01.030
This machine must run into it what I want and then must run it is x number two.

08:01.050 --> 08:10.490
So you have a conflict between two different route to always make a logic when you try to add some route.

08:10.730 --> 08:11.810
So all dysfunction.

08:11.900 --> 08:16.910
How do virtual machine keep voted on without any problem.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.470
So Windows 7 x Keep on its own.

08:19.560 --> 08:27.210
And of course after the end of this group we'll have three virtual machine Vanney and E6 I one that's

08:27.210 --> 08:28.070
me dearest.

08:28.290 --> 08:35.130
Will recalculate the balance of the cluster and we'll McGlade any virtual machine that there is not

08:35.130 --> 08:35.680
conflict.

08:35.700 --> 08:44.730
We do run to another ESX I in my situation we have for example two virtual machine already exists in

08:44.730 --> 08:45.870
the Isak's I want.

08:45.880 --> 08:53.730
So we have four and five other that exists in E6 I want you remember when we deleted that rule to put

08:53.730 --> 08:54.990
this to machine six.

08:55.020 --> 09:01.740
I want him to get it to Windows 7 where they start again as you see he starts migrating to Windows.

09:01.800 --> 09:07.030
Number five how to migrate Windows XP from if I want.

09:07.110 --> 09:10.060
One is to land one.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.220
Of course here you see that the preview task is finished.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.840
It's deeply émigrés.

09:15.850 --> 09:22.040
This machine does great virtual machines 17:6 I tell you is X I want it cluster Morocco.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.360
Then if we refresh this one you'll see that is x.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.490
I wanna know how the machine another machine is come in.

09:29.520 --> 09:37.280
So we have an overloading in is X Y and automatically there is try to balance the loading for the different

09:37.280 --> 09:38.180
hosts.

09:38.260 --> 09:44.810
And of course they will await to touch the Windows 7 and do Windows XP number five.

09:44.960 --> 09:50.820
So it can be when migrate one of those to a machine or maybe both of them will migrated to different

09:50.830 --> 09:53.380
tasks in the cluster.

09:54.130 --> 10:02.480
So this is the idea of the root of unity at the level of the host to the virtual machine.

10:02.480 --> 10:10.270
So the same if we get some other virtual machine to host you can chose must not et cetera.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.660
Then we have do virtual machine to virtual machine.

10:13.760 --> 10:18.600
Of course we need to add our mother group over to your machine.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.510
So lets do it.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.740
So for that we back to the host group.

10:22.940 --> 10:32.400
We try to add a moderate group of the virtual machine VM group then group number two like that we chose

10:32.470 --> 10:40.020
and then we when we chose before chose number 5 and 7.

10:40.150 --> 10:45.530
So for example we chose number four for example like that.

10:45.550 --> 10:49.620
OK of course we can add as much as virtual machine

10:55.930 --> 11:02.220
and we chose virtual machine to virtual machine and we chose group one to group do which a machine in

11:02.220 --> 11:10.120
the VM group work will be restarted the first virtual machine in the group then group 2 will be started

11:10.150 --> 11:10.860
after 1.

11:10.990 --> 11:14.830
When the cluster the poncey restart condition has been made.

11:14.950 --> 11:20.260
So this option when needed if you have some virtual machines that have connection with some other virtual

11:20.260 --> 11:20.740
machine.

11:20.890 --> 11:26.170
For example the group member when you add the virtual machine that's responsible for for example the

11:26.170 --> 11:34.180
active directory DNS the they are C.P. then you'll start the second group of virtual machines that connect

11:34.180 --> 11:43.380
to the active directory or to the DNS to get a name for the different or do the ACP et cetera.

11:43.390 --> 11:48.050
So you chose the one that should restart first thing to save and one that should restart.

11:48.060 --> 11:48.640
SIGURD.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.050
So the next video.
