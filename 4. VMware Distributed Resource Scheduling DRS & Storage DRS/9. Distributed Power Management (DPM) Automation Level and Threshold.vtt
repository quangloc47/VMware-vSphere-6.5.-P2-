00:01.990 --> 00:10.090
This is the option of the dress and you know what does mean power management of the dress.

00:10.090 --> 00:19.030
It's ah option from the and what that help you to see the power of your environment and you should know

00:19.030 --> 00:24.130
that this option is not going to work for a small environment for you.

00:24.130 --> 00:33.320
Five ten twenty seven this option we're not going to hit you because you have smart power consummation

00:34.130 --> 00:37.220
and you have a small number of hosts.

00:37.220 --> 00:37.690
That's me.

00:37.700 --> 00:44.300
Even if you save one or two holes this is not a big deal to do with in your environment.

00:44.480 --> 00:51.770
This is going to work perfectly in a huge environment even a media environment will not going to get

00:51.770 --> 00:58.180
the benefits of the power management for the huge environment that have thousands of thousands of root

00:59.480 --> 01:02.420
servers consume more power.

01:02.420 --> 01:13.850
And when you enable the automation level of the power management this option use the DPM distributed

01:13.910 --> 01:22.180
power management that is do we only use the option of wick or land if you know what does mean recall

01:22.210 --> 01:31.190
that this option used to network to power on a board of a server Trog our physical adapter physical

01:31.190 --> 01:32.210
network adapter.

01:32.480 --> 01:38.960
And of course you showed up a physical network adapter that's supposed to wreak on land like EPM or

01:39.980 --> 01:44.780
to power on the host all your host should have this option.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.320
So you would be able to do power management.

01:48.320 --> 01:57.620
Dennis what this function do put into huge environments that have thousands of thousands of their word

01:57.620 --> 02:03.740
for example like Claudina service series that's how a lot of clients or for example in those big company

02:04.450 --> 02:08.130
the employer gets out from the work.

02:08.770 --> 02:17.120
So our news server will keep powered on even at the midnight and no one is the server.

02:17.360 --> 02:24.620
And even for example the cloud service you might not want it to do cloud service in the midnight but

02:24.620 --> 02:31.570
your hosts keep powered on and the electricity consumed in your company.

02:31.580 --> 02:40.140
So for that to save a lot of electricity you need to power of some host that does not work at the midnight.

02:40.340 --> 02:44.890
So this is the function of do automation Levin of the DPM.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.320
This is the function of the depende distributed power management.

02:48.740 --> 02:57.360
What this function do it Negrete this virtual machine from a specific number of host to the house.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.490
Let's just make it simple and get our smart idea.

03:01.490 --> 03:11.840
For example we have five hosts that use your environment and when the employment gets out at evening

03:12.230 --> 03:13.020
that's mean.

03:13.280 --> 03:19.390
No one is the virtual server that you have in your physical host What's the difference.

03:19.430 --> 03:25.560
We're going to do it will migrate the virtual machine from one or two host to the other host.

03:25.730 --> 03:29.900
And then it will power it off to your house.

03:29.900 --> 03:37.540
Maybe one maybe two hosts or even maybe three posts if you have more space in the other two hosts.

03:37.730 --> 03:46.580
So it's part of the two hosts and get only three host pouted on at all the midnights.

03:46.760 --> 03:55.340
Then in the next day at the morning before the employment start using the server or the service or the

03:55.340 --> 04:03.990
application in you're in your company do Darrow's when powered on to other server and then start migrating

04:04.010 --> 04:13.160
the virtual machine from the other for its own host to the new power it on hosts.

04:13.250 --> 04:21.070
And imagine this scenario into a big company that have a huge server where the address will go into

04:21.090 --> 04:31.310
power of more than fifteen thousand 2000 3000 servers and you will see how much power electricity will

04:31.310 --> 04:38.070
be saved when you powered of about 200 server.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.150
So this is the idea about automation.

04:40.160 --> 04:49.240
Levin of the DPM is bar management and then you can chose to make it all then automate.

04:49.260 --> 04:55.360
Do you do it automatically and manually to chose the option.

04:55.370 --> 05:01.670
Of course we always make it up because it does not have a huge environment just to get the idea about

05:01.670 --> 05:02.630
it.

05:02.630 --> 05:06.550
Then the Distributed power management Titos of cost of Mutual's automatic.

05:06.560 --> 05:14.500
You can chose aggressive or conservative as the same as this but we always get pissed off.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.960
Then we have some other option.

05:17.170 --> 05:25.460
Theres some other ones that do add some a method you click the Add parameter and some value.

05:25.490 --> 05:31.140
So this is the quick idea about to terminate on the DNS in our cluster.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.220
So in the next we do.
