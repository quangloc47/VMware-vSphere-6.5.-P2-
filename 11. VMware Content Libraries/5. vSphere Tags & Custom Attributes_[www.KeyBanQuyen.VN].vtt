WEBVTT

00:02.520 --> 00:03.420
Hello again.

00:03.450 --> 00:07.300
So let's see the difference option we have in the content library.

00:07.350 --> 00:14.880
So if we click on any of the file or the image in the constantly Prady we have some option Rite-Aid

00:14.950 --> 00:17.080
we click on we have updates.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.760
It that's me if we want to make an update for that item.

00:21.980 --> 00:26.550
Chicken is one for example you want to change the contents of these five for example you have a Windows

00:26.550 --> 00:29.540
Server 2012 error.

00:29.910 --> 00:35.450
And for example you have Windows Server 2012 Erewhon and you want to change it.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.960
You dont need to use Arawak anymore.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.970
So you simply click on these shows updates then you upload.

00:41.970 --> 00:46.600
Do you want that you want in this one.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.690
Then we have another option.

00:49.610 --> 00:54.370
Like export its endorsement if you want to export this eason to your local server.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.640
What is up like that.

00:56.390 --> 01:02.720
OK who will try to fetch the content of the reading you will get our download option right there.

01:02.790 --> 01:11.020
Does it send you to a lakh that will lead you to download Perez's download when Server 2012.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.370
So it sent me to download like of course I dont need to download this one right now.

01:16.470 --> 01:21.830
Then we have another option right here that's got it on if you want to clone it from Isel.

01:21.840 --> 01:28.760
Imagine a tablet of a VM in another country that's when you get our model copy of this one in another

01:29.200 --> 01:30.280
Content Library.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.550
Then we have sent Coney's ism that's.

01:35.590 --> 01:42.640
If you use our share it constantly but every You need to start is this from Twitter and time to get

01:42.640 --> 01:48.440
any update in the original image from the external content library.

01:48.440 --> 01:55.010
Delete it and that's when you want to delete it but upload it from a Sherratt constantly Berardi.

01:55.120 --> 02:00.850
But of course it's not available because this won't exist in the rock constantly Bradie not in the external

02:00.850 --> 02:01.160
one.

02:01.180 --> 02:08.210
That's when you can delete only the file from your local content into you Sancho's resides constantly

02:08.440 --> 02:15.550
again then it will download it from the original content library then rename if you want to rename this

02:15.550 --> 02:20.320
one for example all new like that OK.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.340
Chanted the name then we ha it it not.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.050
If you want to change it or not this is Windows Server etc..

02:30.020 --> 02:35.630
Then we hop tag and this tag we're going to talk about it a little.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.550
We have of course delit if you want to delete this one from the quantum leap.

02:39.710 --> 02:43.330
So take a sim take or remove take.

02:43.340 --> 02:45.700
So for example you have different eyes.

02:45.710 --> 02:53.000
Imagine a lot of ways for example one for the window one for the Linux wonderful Macintosh and a lot

02:53.000 --> 02:54.110
lot of eyes.

02:54.120 --> 03:01.670
Imagine for a different service if you buck right here and try to get onÃ©sime it would be difficult

03:01.670 --> 03:04.120
to pick up a right one.

03:04.130 --> 03:11.940
And if you chose to filter right here you can make the research for example server click onto it will

03:12.060 --> 03:13.170
show you all do.

03:13.240 --> 03:22.740
I would imagine that Kwanten Nate Silver also 2016 will show you do well among the top 16 for that.

03:22.740 --> 03:30.720
Also we have a by the Take for example some take that will help you to get quickly to develop Isel imagine

03:30.860 --> 03:31.900
what it was up to.

03:32.040 --> 03:40.320
You don't remember the name exactly but you used to take for example you have 10 ISO image of the Windows

03:40.470 --> 03:41.720
operating system.

03:41.850 --> 03:45.810
Another 10 for the Linux operating system and so on and so on.

03:45.810 --> 03:53.590
You create some Take for example Ald. I imagine that it's about Windows operating system you are at

03:53.600 --> 03:55.230
they call it Windows.

03:55.350 --> 04:01.150
Then another take four different ISO image of Linux and so on and so on.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.750
So it's like a s.a of course.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.040
No half empty.

04:06.510 --> 04:09.920
So we'll need to create some take of course.

04:09.930 --> 04:14.160
If you click on this option right here it will take you to create a new take.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.980
So how does it give you to create a new take.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.070
So the stick can be managed from display right here.

04:22.080 --> 04:32.780
If we back to the home we have the option callet tag of some attribute So Harry you can customize the

04:32.780 --> 04:39.560
different take or the category you concrete's category and tag custom attribute we are of the house

04:39.680 --> 04:43.640
some custom attribute then we create the tag right here.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.260
So to say from displays or from the other place.

04:47.690 --> 04:50.200
So we're back to the content library.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.450
And we try to add a take for one of just five.

04:55.530 --> 05:04.040
So I imagine you have this one example we can make a scene a take then of course we need to up on your

05:04.180 --> 05:17.620
take then we give for example when Windows like that the description or do Windows is Isel airmass.

05:18.010 --> 05:24.570
Then we pick our category we chosen your category if you remember we have take and category but of course

05:24.570 --> 05:26.480
here we don't have a category.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.930
So we need to create one.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.310
So the take is name the name is Windows the description of Windows oys is a must do category we need

05:36.310 --> 05:37.480
to pick up on your one.

05:37.660 --> 05:42.870
So we create a new category category name for example got

05:46.770 --> 05:51.130
or windows or for Isel.

05:51.630 --> 05:56.270
Let's make this category content all the different ISO image.

05:56.460 --> 06:03.850
And we create a tag for Windows and another tag for Linux and another tag for Macintosh etc..

06:03.980 --> 06:09.790
But this we talk about Isel operating system like that.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.920
It's me the ISO that contains two operating system.

06:13.970 --> 06:21.270
Another category for the application under the category for the exchange or for Oracle for the database

06:21.300 --> 06:21.900
etc..

06:21.930 --> 06:27.430
And then you put the different categories like the tag is like a soup category.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.630
So the description if you want to add it.

06:29.700 --> 06:42.350
So then we give it for example description for example in a description voice got the Gorie like that.

06:42.350 --> 06:45.470
Then we chose the cardinality one.

06:45.470 --> 06:50.650
Talk about objects or talk about objects then associated objects 5.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.110
That's me.

06:51.120 --> 06:58.580
This category would be use it for the content library of course you can choose the data store that the

06:58.580 --> 06:59.590
Santer etc..

06:59.750 --> 07:05.630
But here we want to it into a content artist category reserved for the content library.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.870
So we click OK.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.820
No we have our take available.

07:10.940 --> 07:14.060
So we chose for example this one like that.

07:14.060 --> 07:21.300
Then we click OK we go into a scene take to this one so that it gets more example into next.
