Hello and welcome again in this new section.

00:03.450 --> 00:09.610
So not we cover almost all the important two of them where this felt like the full throated almost the

00:09.790 --> 00:14.630
height of the derrieres emotionless dress etc..

00:15.000 --> 00:21.980
No we're going to cover some of them with this fear that we needed from time to time.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.100
In your real environment.

00:24.210 --> 00:28.850
And no we're going to talk about do contain liberty.

00:28.890 --> 00:37.200
We need cover the Clinton Library as quick as possible in the preview course but we don't give it much

00:37.200 --> 00:39.170
time to deep inside it.

00:39.180 --> 00:44.660
No I will try to cover a little about it as fast as possible.

00:44.910 --> 00:51.270
So if you remember when we tried to clone our virtual machine or convert your machine to a template

00:51.550 --> 00:57.990
if you remember we convert to complete or when we try to clone a virtual machine we have clone virtual

00:57.990 --> 01:00.130
machine clone to template.

01:00.250 --> 01:04.160
We cover art first section about the companies in the first world.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.300
So we're not going to talk about this.

01:06.380 --> 01:09.680
They we have grown to templates in library.

01:09.720 --> 01:16.260
If you remember in the course when we tried to clone a template in the library we have empty lists of

01:16.260 --> 01:16.980
library.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.600
Then we go on to create our library.

01:19.650 --> 01:21.690
So at the same time it was we going to do it right.

01:21.690 --> 01:26.280
No we're going to create our library and get a little information about it.
