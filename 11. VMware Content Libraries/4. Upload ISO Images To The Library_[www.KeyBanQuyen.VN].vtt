00:01.110 --> 00:07.180
Blogging so to see another example we can create more templates for example.

00:07.180 --> 00:13.280
Another one for the ISO image if you remember we did this example into Preview.

00:13.660 --> 00:24.380
This is the content of Isel smashed by windows or linux next.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.000
Then we chose locale of course.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.830
We don't charge people just this one.

00:27.830 --> 00:30.670
You can chose repletion next.

00:30.720 --> 00:36.640
Then we use the SHIT IT'S NEXT AND FINISH.

00:36.740 --> 00:39.190
And Harry we see another content deliberately created.

00:39.200 --> 00:45.020
You see people as the password know it's set out to puzzle what the hair is not very well because this

00:45.020 --> 00:46.760
one is not bullshit.

00:46.910 --> 00:51.390
This one is published and it is not protected by a password.

00:52.010 --> 00:56.750
So we click on any one of those templates is the same.

00:57.070 --> 01:02.770
Then of course if you want to import a complete inside this world we can upload it.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.980
So no we have absolutely MUST how template and other fine.

01:07.210 --> 01:12.940
So the other file used to upload the ISO image and any file that you want.

01:12.940 --> 01:18.860
One example some text some pictures or anything that you want.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.400
So let's try an example for example like that.

01:22.310 --> 01:29.420
The same if we have the and or in the lock and we click on the browser then we go right there in the

01:30.560 --> 01:37.420
head you see we have a mouse available of course chose some costume file to use the writer costume if

01:37.480 --> 01:40.160
I can use it in the quantum leap.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.190
Then we can pick up any ISO image that we want.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.970
For example is x.

01:45.010 --> 01:53.210
I am the center server or Windows Server to its ultimate World Order Windows Server 2000 16.

01:53.540 --> 02:00.080
So for example we're going to make an example I said but you should know that this Windows Server 2000

02:00.350 --> 02:02.280
16 and disks don't we.

02:02.450 --> 02:11.640
It's not our real or imagined I'd just create our own image with our file text sized like you see here

02:11.640 --> 02:13.490
is 60 kilobyte.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.210
This is content only took him on file.

02:17.300 --> 02:22.130
So do the size of his image is not as you think.

02:22.130 --> 02:25.450
It's only about less than 1 megabytes.

02:25.490 --> 02:33.340
I did that's true of the time we need to upload this want to get a example so we chose any.

02:33.380 --> 02:39.360
In it of course in real environments you would upload do real Isel image of the operating system.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.790
So here we tools for example this one click open.

02:42.980 --> 02:50.240
Then when you see if you remember when you have an image of our Windows Server You see that's denay

02:50.450 --> 02:56.990
exist like for example x w the x 6 5 et cetera.

02:56.990 --> 03:03.110
You see some specific name like that's the name of the ISO image.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.660
So let's cancel this one and try again.

03:08.150 --> 03:11.690
Browser when we chose for on this one.

03:11.720 --> 03:20.200
You see the denay become like about V.M. where VM 8 on 6 5 it's set up to meet in different environments.

03:20.270 --> 03:29.210
You will not know this is what it is about what is about to do Windows 7 or windows or Windows Server

03:29.240 --> 03:29.940
et cetera.

03:30.080 --> 03:35.330
So for that VM What leads you to customize the name of the.

03:35.570 --> 03:36.200
That's me.

03:36.350 --> 03:41.740
You give me a name that's you can know this is what is about work.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.520
For example this one the eat em all.

03:45.530 --> 03:50.290
I know that this one is about the central server.

03:50.300 --> 04:01.860
So I come right here and click the center server Isel he manage or just the center server 6.5 like.

04:02.160 --> 04:15.510
Then I give it some not because this is the center server with the last update of what was on 2000 11

04:15.810 --> 04:17.280
or anything.

04:17.280 --> 04:22.340
Then you customize the name then you click OK the upload process will start.

04:22.470 --> 04:28.240
But as we tell you this I have about three bytes of size.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.490
I want lights until you upload order 3.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.550
It will take a lot of time.

04:33.570 --> 04:37.120
So for that I chose for example this one like that.

04:37.260 --> 04:41.060
Then we give it a name for example those

04:43.920 --> 04:54.260
sort of 2012 or two like that then this is the Windows Server 2012.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.520
That set.

04:56.570 --> 05:01.140
Then I click OK and upload will start quickly.

05:01.310 --> 05:07.490
Of course it will take a little time because this is a numbers fight it it's the story it's constantly

05:07.490 --> 05:07.890
Berardi.

05:07.940 --> 05:13.560
No it's not because it's still applaud the fight when the fight will be really change.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.930
Yes that is it.

05:14.930 --> 05:16.310
It's changing.

05:16.400 --> 05:16.800
Yes.

05:16.870 --> 05:17.800
Start it.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.640
Look Ali.

05:18.740 --> 05:27.520
That's I mean discontent exist locally when you connect to a Super Bowl plate and you opened other fire

05:27.520 --> 05:34.910
and I hate it you will see all the fine or Ald. exist in do external constantly Berardi.

05:35.060 --> 05:43.070
Then if you chose to download I'll do fine in the content library to the local store you will see them

05:43.250 --> 05:44.440
downloading one by one.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.760
And this started with Chandru trips.

05:46.970 --> 05:54.170
But if you choose to only don't hold the file when you need it when you connect to that external constantly

05:54.170 --> 06:04.040
but you will see that content locally are created by no mean old Isel image from that external content

06:04.040 --> 06:04.840
library.

06:04.970 --> 06:13.800
Still not stored in locally when you click or use any of those eyes imagine the external content library.

06:13.920 --> 06:21.020
Every time when you use one of them for example you use the Windows server do VM where it will download.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.160
That is what imagine you look on and use it.

06:24.200 --> 06:30.830
Then when you're back right to seek I'll do one that you use it changes from no to yes and so on and

06:30.830 --> 06:37.350
so on then decide the last modification and last synchronisation because this one exists in the lock.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.950
So it is not Sankaran easy.

06:39.950 --> 06:47.070
So the same for example Windows 2016 like that.

06:47.160 --> 06:53.710
So we changed the name Windows Server 2016.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.360
We click OK it will download this one right.

06:59.770 --> 07:00.890
So how is it.

07:00.910 --> 07:02.980
That's the content liberally.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.070
So next we'll see more about these.
