00:01.800 --> 00:02.450
Blogging.

00:02.670 --> 00:06.070
So we have the first plate created succinctly.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.410
The type is local because we chose our local library then.

00:10.630 --> 00:11.850
It is not me.

00:12.030 --> 00:17.040
This library is not shared for the other Vicent over the password.

00:17.130 --> 00:20.500
We don't give it any password automatic synchronisation.

00:20.520 --> 00:25.060
We do not have any automatic synchronization because this is a locally.

00:25.180 --> 00:27.740
Then how much templates are really built inside this one.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.650
Mean the template of the virtual machine.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.770
Then other library storage you use it.

00:32.830 --> 00:41.400
Several megabytes then creation that today and last modification of these Content Library last synchronization

00:41.490 --> 00:46.080
not available because we do not use external promptly.

00:46.080 --> 00:51.210
So if we click on it or we just simply click right there we see the details about this one.

00:51.330 --> 00:53.730
What is a local content library.

00:53.730 --> 00:56.160
This is a quick overview about it.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.800
They have the Samari that give you information about this one.

00:59.850 --> 01:06.860
And it the logo of the constant library local that store zero bytes Atum streaming optimisation.

01:06.870 --> 01:07.430
No.

01:07.550 --> 01:13.800
Then the date and the last modification datastore is in the lunch or the starter is normal the type

01:13.800 --> 01:18.980
is VTM else the capacity and the free space that exists in the lab.

01:18.990 --> 01:23.450
Number two so do we have some config.

01:23.450 --> 01:29.060
Of course we can configure this one if you remember when we could use this one and chose that work locally

01:29.060 --> 01:30.170
without repletion it.

01:30.170 --> 01:37.370
We can click on edits and we can chose to publish this content to liberty externally so we click on

01:37.720 --> 01:43.160
it give you Do you have all of this constantly Bradie if you remember this want to subscribe to our

01:43.160 --> 01:44.370
content library thats me.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.370
Anyone who want to connect to the library should use this.

01:48.430 --> 01:53.160
Your When center vote and all and do information right here.

01:53.170 --> 02:00.810
And if you remember issue us if we chose to publish this one across the GDP you will see that Lancry

02:00.820 --> 02:04.790
terror will be ETP and not issue utopias.

02:05.030 --> 02:10.460
Then if you want to add a password we simply click on here at the post war and so on and so on.

02:10.820 --> 02:17.510
So this is not our situation right here because we dont have another external the center server to use

02:17.510 --> 02:19.060
it to connect to this one.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.420
Then we have the template.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.240
How much dominates we have in this new content library.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.870
Of course the complete right here does not mean the name top right.

02:27.020 --> 02:33.370
We put only the complete name right there to know that this is about the Toeplitz of the virtual machine.

02:33.470 --> 02:37.720
Then some other times if you want to add some other types of file.

02:37.910 --> 02:43.910
So if we check this one and try to import it in the template thats mean we want to put our templates

02:44.000 --> 02:45.410
of our virtual machine.

02:45.480 --> 02:51.610
So you see import import of the package content library.

02:51.760 --> 02:58.410
We click on this then we select the if package or other find tip import.

02:58.430 --> 03:05.220
If we have for example your URL or the view if we can put it right here then it will upload.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.130
Because of that virtual machine or that template of the virtual machine.

03:10.130 --> 03:15.170
Then we have a look at if you want to chose the template from the look and of course we don't have any

03:15.260 --> 03:22.850
templates right here if you remember when we are back to do is X I host right here and we try to export

03:22.910 --> 03:24.570
our virtual machine like that.

03:24.590 --> 03:32.980
We chose it as its export of the plate that we want to export as virtual machine as an avi populate

03:33.310 --> 03:43.540
we can back to constantly Berardi and to upload the avi fine inside this content library like that.

03:43.600 --> 03:51.690
So we started we have only five we put a new name right here and do not write here.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.070
This template that we created in this country.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.890
Of course we dont have any templates available right.

03:57.890 --> 04:02.590
No lets try to create a template for our virtual machine.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.430
So we want to chose a numpty virtual machine to avoid that type.

04:07.900 --> 04:11.790
It has not been Windows 7 but its an empty virtual machine.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.740
We got to Cloyne

04:17.480 --> 04:25.340
Claunch a place in a library they know we have the Pompey's exists of course if we already have a template

04:25.370 --> 04:32.540
of this virtual machine exists in the library we can use this one to do it or to update the existing

04:32.650 --> 04:33.350
employees.

04:33.380 --> 04:39.110
But no we don't have if you want to click right here would give it a name to the one for example the

04:39.110 --> 04:49.040
entry template like that then the description Breezer much of that is on network that we want to keep

04:49.040 --> 04:53.930
it the same MAC address of course it's not recommended every time when you deploy a virtual machine

04:53.930 --> 04:58.870
from the companies you need to get on your mac address didn't include extra configuration.

04:58.870 --> 05:04.120
If you want to add some configuration of the operation system like do the user name the password and

05:04.120 --> 05:05.180
so on and so on.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.450
So we click OK.

05:06.550 --> 05:07.990
It would create a complete

05:11.390 --> 05:13.780
that is to export populate.

05:14.090 --> 05:19.460
Let's hate are getting start with all needed.

05:20.040 --> 05:26.350
So the expert says will take a little time and do if we were to be available in the content the body

05:27.440 --> 05:35.960
export of the complete upload fight if you remember from the previous course we see all the step.

05:36.280 --> 05:43.780
So cloning two of you have done plate's export to over populate then upload file then transfer files

05:43.780 --> 05:50.470
to a shared storage from the is X Y number 3 then upload it to the library.

05:50.470 --> 05:55.700
It creates the template inside the local host of this virtual machine.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.890
Then upload fine.

05:58.900 --> 06:09.240
So if we're back to the complete content library template No we have our plates.

06:09.290 --> 06:13.720
Let's call it win 7 Number three template.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.100
So you know next video for more details.
