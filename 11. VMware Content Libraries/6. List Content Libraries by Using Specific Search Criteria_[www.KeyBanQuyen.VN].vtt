00:00.500 --> 00:06.970
Blogging so I just upload to other Isel image to make the idea.

00:07.140 --> 00:13.020
So we go for example this one drills this one and try to add a new tag.

00:13.410 --> 00:19.560
So like that of course we can chose this tag all we can create a new one like that.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.150
So for example we call it Linux then on

00:27.600 --> 00:33.110
Linux Produkt like that.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.670
Then we can pick up our category or we choose another category.

00:36.680 --> 00:52.620
One example Linux choice like that on the Linux Produkt and OS then we chose the quantum leap.

00:52.890 --> 00:54.900
Click OK.

00:55.010 --> 01:01.710
So how does it know we can pick up the second one don't like that we click OK.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.760
So this one have a tag of Unix.

01:04.850 --> 01:07.810
Then we ordered another take it to the elder Isel.

01:07.920 --> 01:16.240
Imagine a scene then this one if the we don't give it Windows.

01:16.430 --> 01:20.090
So it's either you have a Windows sort it only shows Linux.

01:20.210 --> 01:24.100
Then we go to this one a scene tag.

01:24.100 --> 01:27.520
So we have windows a scene and so on and so on.

01:27.850 --> 01:36.760
So when we use the filter right here to search for a specific word for example Linux to get on do find

01:36.760 --> 01:44.470
that have named nukes or for example oys like that Santo's that content OS and Linux that's content

01:44.650 --> 01:49.770
last or maybe 2012 like that you get to do Windows 2000.

01:49.820 --> 01:50.320
Well.

01:50.680 --> 01:58.300
If you want to use the filter we can simply use this put on re-attached show anti-Greek filter and click

01:58.300 --> 02:01.700
on it and it show you do that the tag.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.760
Of course you can click on this one to get to the available tag.

02:04.810 --> 02:09.160
For example you had thousands tag you can't remember the name exactly.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.340
You simply click on this one and check the tag available all.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.690
If you remember the name you said please tape Linux of course it will give you a reason that is it.

02:19.960 --> 02:24.790
Then it will show you all the eyes will emerge that have to take Linux.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.280
They storeyed constantly locally.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.510
If you remember this one started content locally you chose yes to show your all.

02:32.860 --> 02:37.720
These are images that have the tag Linux and store it in the content library.

02:37.770 --> 02:44.940
For example if you use our shared content library you can chose not to get all.

02:45.070 --> 02:50.040
Do That's still not downloaded from shedded content library.

02:50.890 --> 02:57.850
So this is the idea of the filter to make the search as quick as possible so like that no you have or

02:57.870 --> 02:59.260
image of nukes.

02:59.470 --> 03:07.060
If you want to embark on only to isolate the mass of Windows you pick this one like that and all the

03:07.060 --> 03:12.060
windows I imagine will be available also to complete the same idea.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.880
That's back to the content here already.

03:15.460 --> 03:22.540
And back to the complex of VM the same writer we don't have any other firefighter but we only have Windows

03:22.660 --> 03:23.670
7 plays.

03:23.800 --> 03:30.100
So the same right here you can search for example for Windows 7 like that or use the filter of course

03:30.100 --> 03:32.460
we don't have any tag right yet.

03:32.640 --> 03:39.580
Then you chose Vanderpump plate or VM up if you remember we can create our templates for the video machine

03:39.610 --> 03:47.740
or for the virtual up someplace you can chose that add up to all the virtual up of your table or virtual

03:47.740 --> 03:50.660
machine to get all the virtual machine.

03:51.160 --> 03:59.110
Also in our bomblet fight in the content library of some other option available we have to update export

03:59.310 --> 04:00.040
and.

04:00.150 --> 04:05.830
We have a new vitrine machine from the complete in the previous course about which we talk about how

04:05.830 --> 04:09.060
to create a virtual machine from our complete.

04:09.310 --> 04:15.200
So we are going to repeat this step because we already see it and it is very simple.

04:15.460 --> 04:18.630
So this is the different information about the content delivery.

04:18.670 --> 04:24.460
If you have information please share it in the core discussion and see you in the next section.
