00:02.350 --> 00:03.240
Allegan in.

00:03.260 --> 00:11.290
So no we have the stars dictated by ice Kazee software adapter in this house and all the other hosts

00:11.710 --> 00:19.040
if we check the store device you will see that we have to start doing hard drive work available or attach

00:19.040 --> 00:21.210
it to this house.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.700
That's me and the host can see just how hard I work.

00:24.760 --> 00:31.360
And you see the transport is drove the ice Kaze the used cars you do parallel that to me and connects

00:31.360 --> 00:33.130
directly to the host.

00:33.160 --> 00:41.390
This one is the cd dvd driver and this is used ice Kazee transport to connected those hard drives.

00:41.590 --> 00:49.970
So the next step as quick as possible we go to the store we click on Neil thought we chose the this

00:50.080 --> 00:53.190
is the most one want to use.

00:53.230 --> 00:54.640
Then we give it a name.

00:54.700 --> 01:01.530
If you remember Line 1 like that it's too like that.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.590
Then we chose one that we want for example this this first one.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.400
The second one don't get about it.

01:07.420 --> 01:12.980
It's our look at how the driver in this house is important next.

01:13.210 --> 01:15.370
Then we call the DMF six.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.090
OK.

01:16.190 --> 01:22.290
Next then if you remember you chose the space reclamation cost.

01:22.390 --> 01:30.700
We leave it as it were then the size of the store would click next and finish and you would see on your

01:30.790 --> 01:37.580
land update to this house and the same you want to do some storage.

01:38.290 --> 01:45.400
The motion for the machine and for the Stosh we need to add a and external storage to practice some

01:45.490 --> 01:47.580
other features.

01:47.920 --> 01:59.630
So line number two like that we chose the second one with the 45 gigabyte next next and next and finish.

01:59.650 --> 02:03.210
So no we have two storage in this house.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.150
Number one it will take time to create it.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.900
So as far as now Line 1 and line top and the same step we're going to do it four to six.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.360
I but two and six and a buddy.

02:14.380 --> 02:25.630
So it automatically detect distrust because we are connected to the extent Astro's drug do storage adapter

02:25.710 --> 02:27.090
that we created before.

02:27.280 --> 02:34.220
So all the host will detect do new store and others as an external storage.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.520
This one Dickstein to the other.

02:36.720 --> 02:43.980
Lets see this Hoffland want to check this Swane OK.

02:44.310 --> 02:51.490
Then to it's not really her it's it's a little time

02:55.470 --> 03:00.080
does it just need a little refresh to show up in our house.

03:00.460 --> 03:05.890
So automatically all the holes that connect with the same target will detect two new configuration and

03:06.090 --> 03:14.380
that automatically so soon the next section that we'll start using to advance a future of the VM what

03:14.580 --> 03:15.670
we've seen in the next the next.
