00:02.160 --> 00:03.120
Hello again.

00:03.150 --> 00:10.260
So let's try to add an external stars for the different toasts and let's do this example for the host

00:10.260 --> 00:15.360
Number two if you remember from the preview calls we see the step 2.

00:15.380 --> 00:22.520
Up next and on Stardust but let's get a quick refresh to do it again for your love.

00:22.890 --> 00:27.330
So if you remember we got to do HOUSE CALL.

00:27.390 --> 00:34.470
And in the storage which shows that the first step that we need to connect an external storage we need

00:34.740 --> 00:45.680
to have be a network adapter or if we don't have an HP network or physical other we just use do software

00:45.870 --> 00:51.990
scuzzy adapter so we enable the software as an adapter in this host.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.050
OK.

00:53.520 --> 00:58.230
Then we'll charge the to our eyes cause the adapter opened fire with both.

00:58.410 --> 01:05.160
So you see here have to ask cause what are the adapter just added a quick overview about it.

01:05.160 --> 01:12.690
The device this place that we should see the different storage available with the ice Kaze adapter the

01:12.690 --> 01:19.830
interface of those We're going to use it to get to the direct beat for the storage the target and the

01:19.830 --> 01:23.370
network bandwidth and some other option.

01:23.490 --> 01:31.150
And if you remember we need to band in our network adapter to do ice Kazee software.

01:31.170 --> 01:37.270
If you remember that I mean this is a software that will convert a physical adapter to our eyes cause

01:37.280 --> 01:41.460
the adapter that will detect the ice cores is gone.

01:42.330 --> 01:48.930
And of course as this is what we need to connect connected to our physical network adapter an Ethernet

01:49.410 --> 01:56.140
adapter to work with it as our eyes Kaze or an HP adapter.

01:56.430 --> 02:05.010
So we click right there to a network portal and into our board you will see that we have to be kept

02:05.000 --> 02:06.330
now available.

02:06.350 --> 02:10.220
Do we use it as an ice Kazee for the group.

02:10.260 --> 02:19.250
So we click on any of them you see compliant that's mean this network adapter the tabbed VM can to is

02:19.250 --> 02:22.260
compliant to be use it as eyes Karzi.

02:22.330 --> 02:28.640
But then the second one the same if we chose for example a VM network tree it's not compliant that's

02:28.640 --> 02:31.090
mean you can't use this physical adapter.

02:31.140 --> 02:36.280
Ours are nice KEZI port to connect to do scuzzy us.

02:36.500 --> 02:43.520
So we chose one off them check them together or we just try we do one of them to send the example.

02:43.520 --> 02:51.260
So we click OK and then you will see all the data in the recent conflict.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.740
It is kind of distorted about the Oracle on it.

02:53.780 --> 03:01.910
So you see do I see Kaze the VM Carolan a Jew that is compliant is connected to the usage for this ice

03:01.910 --> 03:06.660
Kazee software adapter as our port and its work.

03:06.930 --> 03:10.290
So weve been doing this network a number six.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.940
We do ice the software.

03:13.010 --> 03:15.340
So we think we do it again.

03:15.350 --> 03:23.690
You would see that we only have one VM can have available to be bent to the eyes Kaze adapter click

03:23.860 --> 03:24.480
OK.

03:26.050 --> 03:32.070
So now we have two physical adapter bendin to do ice Kaze software.

03:32.320 --> 03:37.140
So as we do this congressional we need to rescan.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.610
So we click iscan like that.

03:39.690 --> 03:40.300
OK.

03:41.190 --> 03:44.220
So you see ahead rescan all it should be.

03:44.440 --> 03:52.110
And Alda DMF is available if we box a device of course we are not going to see anything because we do

03:52.150 --> 03:54.150
not have any targets yet.

03:54.230 --> 04:02.270
So this ice Kaze no work but actually we are bonding your network adapter and to VM government this

04:02.450 --> 04:06.650
is Kaze and then the next step is added the device.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.020
We didn't not have any device yet.

04:09.230 --> 04:12.940
So we got to the targets are the same as we did in the previews.

04:13.250 --> 04:20.320
We click on it and we chose the IP address or do I the storage or extend our storage.

04:20.330 --> 04:24.310
In my situation I use a software splodge start.

04:24.350 --> 04:32.090
And of course you can use for instance or open file or any software for Create your luck of course from

04:32.090 --> 04:33.860
the preview course we used.

04:34.060 --> 04:41.590
And it's our simple truth that we help you to create an external externals for practicing what you will

04:41.600 --> 04:43.580
going to learn from this.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.410
So I give you the address of the storage.

04:47.570 --> 04:49.090
This is the test.

04:49.230 --> 04:49.970
OK.

04:51.370 --> 04:55.100
So do two reasons conflict change arest kind of distortion that is all.

04:55.210 --> 05:08.490
So we click Riskin OK and then we shall see are your devices that light.

05:08.570 --> 05:15.900
As we say here we have two storage available to start with and ice Kazee disk.

05:15.910 --> 05:18.500
Number one that's have 14 gigabytes.

05:18.560 --> 05:24.030
They do i scuzzy disk number two that have forty five gigabytes.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.100
So it's work perfectly.

05:26.140 --> 05:35.860
So no we have to do was dictated by the software Drobo do part of the physical adapter number 6 and

05:35.860 --> 05:39.410
7 by using the VM kernel 2 and 3.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.270
So this is the idea how to do that.

05:41.290 --> 05:46.290
So if we chiggers a different bait as you said we have to device.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.220
But when we check the page we have four.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.210
That's me.

05:51.270 --> 05:56.900
This is the disk number one if you Racan itat you get some idea of how to do this.

05:59.140 --> 06:08.210
You see this I mean the one L 0 and this is D1 and did all that understeer and the one ha 0 and 0 0

06:08.420 --> 06:18.890
0 0 this is meaning that this is the same spot on I-10 but why we have two of them because we have two

06:19.270 --> 06:29.570
board bent into this ice Kaze So that's mean the them can end them but to have direct bait to the storage

06:29.690 --> 06:38.090
number one and do them come in and B-tree that's made the Stigand network have a connection with the

06:38.090 --> 06:47.570
same first storage bin number take 1 0 then do the second story was seen by two physical adapter and

06:47.630 --> 06:49.010
two V.M. come in.

06:49.010 --> 06:54.680
That's why we see midship of two stories available in our external storage.
