WEBVTT

00:00.440 --> 00:07.250
And another function that I will do is do of ice Kaze the anchorman for ice Kazee management.

00:07.470 --> 00:15.160
I click our network of course we chose them Gernon Knittle covert Aldo's step into part of your course.

00:15.180 --> 00:21.700
So next we chose the same materials which then Davian Cornejo we'll call it for example II.

00:22.110 --> 00:30.730
Scott Z for example one like that of course we don't not have the villain in our love so I can't charge

00:30.840 --> 00:37.310
bill but of course if you have Oswiecim that have an idea you can use it.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.430
So then where we don't chose any of the service because we want to you just want to extend up splosh

00:43.710 --> 00:55.020
ice Gazi then we give it an IP address and the same as we did in the example 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and this

00:55.020 --> 00:56.000
for example.

00:56.010 --> 01:04.790
Give me a true 10 like about two hundred and ten that's mean this is the IP address of the.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.690
Number one that have to be addressed in the industry.

01:08.700 --> 01:16.560
NET and of course we can use the same DNS right.

01:16.840 --> 01:25.850
Then next as you see the ties finish and we will have on your eyes cause the part and the same way of

01:25.890 --> 01:33.310
a second one because we want to have two separate ice Kazee to avoid any problem for one of them.

01:33.310 --> 01:39.230
So we clipped the second one work Heiss call Z.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.250
Talk like that.

01:41.400 --> 01:54.510
Then next the BTP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and 2 to then for example we add one to the IP address so to

01:54.630 --> 01:56.190
11 that's me.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.950
Two hundred ten and two hundred eleven is for do I scuzzy

02:04.570 --> 02:05.340
next.

02:05.590 --> 02:08.690
And finish them.

02:08.710 --> 02:14.800
Of course we need to connect them to one step but it's got its eyes cause you want is our physical adapter

02:14.890 --> 02:17.350
we need it is it like that.

02:17.450 --> 02:21.840
The security we don't change any tank and it came in and fell over.

02:21.850 --> 02:26.790
We chose overate and we chose to do the last one is available.

02:26.830 --> 02:32.660
We chose like that we chose and use it.

02:32.780 --> 02:36.950
After 7 also use it like that.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.060
Retools do number 6.

02:39.280 --> 02:39.900
OK.

02:41.250 --> 02:46.000
So no ice cores use only two physical adapter number 6.

02:46.110 --> 02:47.120
Ice Karzi tool.

02:47.250 --> 02:51.160
We do the same thing for the VM Annaik 7.

02:51.350 --> 03:03.530
So tainment and over overlayed shows like Godard's down to the adapter is only the number 7.

03:04.020 --> 03:04.800
OK.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.770
And here we go.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.620
So no we have this actually dictu.

03:09.860 --> 03:13.790
We check that this is actually the actor that I see.

03:13.800 --> 03:20.610
It will be good for an environment of course more physical adapter thats more and more redundancy.

03:21.710 --> 03:24.290
So the number one is the VM.

03:24.290 --> 03:28.770
Nick sake's we raise two hundred ten.

03:28.810 --> 03:35.610
Its information about the host number one that have to be 10 then to cause the number to use the VM

03:35.610 --> 03:41.240
Minick number 7 and we give it an IP address of two hundred eleven.

03:41.360 --> 03:49.430
Then we chose the management network for the host doesn't mean the VM Correll of the holes that we connect

03:49.430 --> 03:50.560
to manage the host.

03:50.570 --> 03:58.580
We did we give it to the Emenike 0 and 1 would then the VM network thats me for the virtual machine

03:58.760 --> 04:03.110
at the virtual machine is the Minick for five.

04:03.470 --> 04:08.300
And do the motion we raise one hundred ten.

04:08.300 --> 04:13.080
We took the network adapter number two and three.

04:13.250 --> 04:17.720
This is the actually texture that I can feel this has used.

04:17.870 --> 04:26.990
And I will do the same for the US number two and number three the same crude to have a good redundancy

04:26.990 --> 04:29.010
for Esch of our server.

04:29.120 --> 04:29.870
So the next.
