00:01.620 --> 00:02.590
Hello again.

00:02.650 --> 00:11.650
So let's get an idea about this chalk board but then as you say we've been in top physical adapter to

00:11.650 --> 00:20.320
the ice Kaze Stosh and for example if we back right there to the switch and we see this as causes Talaash

00:20.320 --> 00:22.100
connected a VM neck 7.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.210
And as Kaze one connected a VMC.

00:25.360 --> 00:34.450
If for example disconnect the cable from the VM Minick 7 and we try to back to see the storage right

00:34.450 --> 00:35.090
there.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.240
If you remember I had it when I see the first one is oxi no one likes you then the bait.

00:41.260 --> 00:42.240
We have four.

00:42.280 --> 00:42.900
That's me.

00:43.090 --> 00:45.960
Every port seek to extend its rush.

00:46.150 --> 00:51.690
Let's get the implant of the cabinet from the other server.

00:51.770 --> 00:59.140
It is a one OK imply that the cable OK.

00:59.210 --> 01:04.360
If we to the virtual switch you should see that this cable is disconnected.

01:04.600 --> 01:09.530
Let's just give it a little time or let's just to refresh.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.040
So how does it do.

01:11.050 --> 01:14.780
VM Network 7 is disconnected from the network.

01:15.060 --> 01:22.980
And if we go back to the start as a writer and we make our rescan you see right there you see it's automatically

01:22.980 --> 01:23.750
detected.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.450
So the last act you not use it.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.690
This is the last one.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.580
Is that still active and this is the VM neck 3.

01:32.610 --> 01:40.680
That's when we VM Network 7 is not use it and into but if we make a refresh you will see that we have

01:40.680 --> 01:49.000
only to bake that scene by ice Kaze software adapter.

01:49.550 --> 01:56.840
So how does it only have two external storage that's seen by one network adapter.

01:56.990 --> 02:04.570
So if we plug the cable again it OK.

02:04.580 --> 02:07.470
No it shows the connect.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.960
There's one way ahead.

02:10.310 --> 02:17.420
If we box to the adapter it will detect automatically just give it a little time and we'll be use it

02:17.480 --> 02:18.120
again.

02:20.310 --> 02:23.760
As it's thought detected change by it's.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.190
OK.

02:27.430 --> 02:33.770
So it starts to give me a refresh or hourly scan OK.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.630
No it's active.

02:38.950 --> 02:46.260
If we walk to the gate you can see that it's become for connection to do to external storage.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.570
So this is our quick information.

02:48.630 --> 02:52.680
Now we need to do the same step for the other six I.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.850
I already do it with my number two.

02:56.140 --> 02:59.010
And then we're going to do it in six ion battery.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.950
And no we're going to do it quickly.

03:02.020 --> 03:11.110
So we got to do a network port with click on network port to bundle to network port to Physica network

03:11.110 --> 03:14.490
adapter to this scuzzy software.

03:14.550 --> 03:15.260
OK.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.520
What is it.

03:18.570 --> 03:27.020
Then we go to the targets we need to add a new target to the address of the externals last 11.

03:27.050 --> 03:33.120
OK at Izzet if we box a device in amps you would need to rescan.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.430
OK.

03:34.810 --> 03:44.670
And you will see to extend Ostergaard will be 60 for the head is the disk 1 and a disk 2 14 and 45.

03:44.950 --> 03:46.650
The target base.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.550
We have four.

03:47.590 --> 03:52.540
That means the two port bending actively together.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.550
So the next step is to do external storage.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.780
So in the next video.
