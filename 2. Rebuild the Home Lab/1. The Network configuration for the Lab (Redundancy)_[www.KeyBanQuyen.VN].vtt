WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:01.330
Slugging.

00:01.620 --> 00:10.350
So let's get a quick overview about do in your lab that I created and do step that we need to do to

00:10.410 --> 00:17.110
start our audience would love it and discover more futures on the VM where despair 6.5.

00:17.430 --> 00:24.900
So as I told you I created the center their work I create the center kind of Morocco and I treat Isak's

00:24.990 --> 00:32.340
I hauls in this that the center to start managing them and practice on them and you see we have three

00:32.410 --> 00:35.850
that thought this is the local store of eche of those ethics.

00:35.930 --> 00:38.750
I I one have that one in six.

00:38.760 --> 00:44.940
I do have that one and E-6 Atri you have to do that astore number two.

00:45.270 --> 00:53.190
The next step is do up a knew that I should add that I store or external storage as I convert it into

00:53.190 --> 00:55.410
Preview calls and stiction.

00:55.560 --> 01:02.880
But I will repeat the steps quickly not as much as I did into your course but just a quick overview

01:03.090 --> 01:09.920
like our refresh do start in the right way for our next sections.

01:10.170 --> 01:19.530
So then if we back to the E6 I number one I make some network integration to work perfectly.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.920
And this is like Indurain environment.

01:23.100 --> 01:30.490
It is always will start configuring the network perfectly to work without any problem for the next few

01:30.570 --> 01:31.330
years.

01:31.540 --> 01:37.850
So we got you coffee and let's get a quicker view about seating.

01:37.980 --> 01:45.410
And if you've got a physical adapter you will see that I have eight network adapter in this house.

01:45.510 --> 01:49.910
I created this yes I want with a network adapter.

01:49.910 --> 01:57.180
Its like in an environment if you have a physical host we have eight or 10 or 20 network adapter or

01:57.180 --> 01:58.290
physical adapter.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.160
Its the same.

01:59.390 --> 02:09.020
But for my love I chose to get at least 8 network adapter and you will see why we needed to create our

02:09.150 --> 02:11.610
safe environment for our love.

02:11.640 --> 02:16.310
And of course in the same as in the rate environment do have a safe environment.

02:16.460 --> 02:21.730
You need at least eight network adapter of course six or four.

02:21.730 --> 02:22.600
Its good.

02:22.710 --> 02:32.280
But my idea here is to sit tight ish service for a separate network adapter and I chose to network adapter

02:32.280 --> 02:35.330
for a service to have redundancy.

02:35.670 --> 02:41.400
If you remember we always get an alarmist was that this service used by one physical network adapter

02:41.510 --> 02:48.210
those not have redundancy that's mean if something wrong happened to this network adapter this musical

02:48.210 --> 02:52.940
adapter do service will last Edes function.

02:53.010 --> 02:58.470
So they always wanted to have at least two network adapter for each of those surveys.

02:58.470 --> 03:02.010
For example the height of ability the motion etc..

03:02.070 --> 03:07.470
So I create ish Isak's I host with at least eight network adapter.

03:07.770 --> 03:12.230
And then I separate them for different service.

03:12.270 --> 03:18.570
So if you box to video switch and we click on the videos which we have in this host is X I number one

03:18.900 --> 03:26.150
you see here that we have eight physical adapter and there we see that we have a service we have a do

03:26.280 --> 03:27.700
management network.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.260
If we click on Nate I give it the address number 10.

03:31.290 --> 03:36.230
If you remember this is the IP address that we created with the VM Cornelis 0.

03:36.360 --> 03:45.030
If we address 1 9 2 8 1 6 8 to 1 but 10 and this is the one that we use to connect to the house E6 I

03:45.030 --> 03:51.000
want this VM kernel or the management network use to network adapter.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.610
The first one and the second one thats me.

03:53.640 --> 03:59.550
If something wrong happened to this physical adapter I still have a connection to this host draw with

03:59.790 --> 04:06.300
SIGINT physical adapter and of course if you have more physical other it is always how common it is

04:06.360 --> 04:13.020
more than two for example four or five is in the region about how much physical adapter available in

04:13.020 --> 04:15.630
your server or in your hosts.

04:15.990 --> 04:22.280
But this is the most Rock'em on the minimum recommendation is to get to network adapter.

04:22.290 --> 04:29.000
Of course the requirement is at least one recommendation minimum recommendation is do more physical.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.210
Laughter is always good for the VM network.

04:33.210 --> 04:39.420
Thats me in the virtual machine in this host will do the a miniature adapter number four and number

04:39.420 --> 04:39.840
five.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.900
That's mean to physical adapter.

04:42.980 --> 04:49.910
I mean all those virtual machine in this house will connect to the network through two physical adapter.

04:49.980 --> 04:54.700
Then I create our mother the kernel for the Wii motion.

04:54.780 --> 05:03.890
I chose this one for the Wii motion and they give it back address one like thats 110 just separated

05:04.310 --> 05:05.780
from other the internet.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.260
E.P. I chose number 10 and I am the one that's mean if you see the VM.

05:11.330 --> 05:13.510
It other is 110.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.800
That's me this is for the host number 10.

05:15.980 --> 05:24.020
And for example the hot number 20 I chose one 20 then fill the holes in them but three I chose one 13

05:24.090 --> 05:26.980
etc. just on if B that I chose.

05:27.030 --> 05:36.520
Thats helped me easy to remember which parts I use and wish VM Cairney ease for weesh costs in our environment.

05:36.560 --> 05:45.340
So then we shouldnt also give it to come into work and after the Imake to make the so this is for the

05:45.370 --> 05:45.820
motion.
