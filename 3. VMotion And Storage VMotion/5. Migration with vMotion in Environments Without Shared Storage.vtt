00:01.490 --> 00:02.470
Help again.

00:02.640 --> 00:10.260
So no we'll going to see another example for migrating out virtually on a machine from a local store

00:10.500 --> 00:17.800
to another host or that you do look out the store or do shit in that store.

00:18.330 --> 00:23.200
So this would take this example of this virtual machine that is powered on.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.750
It's the same as Bharath on or opponent.

00:26.040 --> 00:32.930
And this machine is to store the look out the start of the Isak's I want if we try to immigrate it is

00:33.080 --> 00:34.540
I number two.

00:34.680 --> 00:41.820
And if you remember to migrate Ah parishioner's only from a virgin machine that was on local store.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.190
It is impossible.

00:43.620 --> 00:50.730
You can go to the next step you will get on a road that this machine have a new suit to immigrate to

00:50.760 --> 00:54.500
another house because it's used the local store.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.920
But of course if we choose to migrate stores only it's so dark.

00:59.070 --> 00:59.680
That's me.

00:59.790 --> 01:06.290
You can migrate to our shared storage but another option.

01:06.370 --> 01:14.610
But if we try to chose both of them the resource and the storage it will work perfectly because it will

01:14.850 --> 01:22.710
migrate to stores first then when it will migrate to storage do the resource will be available to be

01:22.800 --> 01:24.090
migrated if we chose.

01:24.090 --> 01:30.010
When I was on ethics I took a six i3 walk the next day.

01:30.380 --> 01:36.870
We can chose to look at the store of this host but to me it will migrate the storage of the virtual

01:36.870 --> 01:37.510
machine.

01:37.560 --> 01:47.160
Windows 7 from the local storage of do E6 I want to look all that I store of E-6 I do in this case do

01:47.310 --> 01:53.240
is excite them but you can raid do store hours of this one.

01:53.460 --> 01:57.440
But of course there are a complex process that will happen right.

01:57.870 --> 02:04.170
Because when we migrate to the hard drive of his virtual machine from the local storage this one to

02:04.170 --> 02:06.090
do local store of the host.

02:06.120 --> 02:15.970
But to do resouce use it from this machine from the Isak's I want were not to be able to access to storage

02:16.060 --> 02:20.860
of the virtual machine that save it in storage or to Isak's.

02:20.910 --> 02:25.640
I stop behind the scene or in the background what's happened.

02:26.480 --> 02:32.900
Do the it will make great storage of this virtual machine.

02:32.970 --> 02:34.260
Do Windows 7.

02:34.270 --> 02:38.950
Number one from Mukalla the start of iOS 6.

02:39.270 --> 02:45.010
I want to assure that storage will chose any of those shedded Stosh.

02:45.180 --> 02:53.380
Then when the storage of this machine saved it into a sheet it's trash.

02:53.450 --> 03:00.410
That's me and all the host can get access to do a hard drive out of this virtual machine in a shared

03:00.470 --> 03:01.480
storage.

03:01.610 --> 03:07.120
Then the next process is to make great resource use it.

03:07.200 --> 03:15.820
There's this option Right-Hand will do this process first then hit back and charge the computer resources

03:16.370 --> 03:19.340
later from the e6.

03:19.340 --> 03:21.250
I number 1 to 6.

03:21.290 --> 03:22.220
Number two.

03:22.280 --> 03:26.980
No the machine is still running and is the resource of the Isak's.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.430
I number two and use the shared storage that it is accessible from Isak's.

03:33.440 --> 03:43.340
I never took them as third step is to migrate the data or the body of the virtual machine from the shared

03:43.360 --> 03:46.740
trash to the local storage of it.

03:46.770 --> 03:48.550
I number two.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.410
So this is a long process.

03:51.710 --> 03:56.600
If we try to do it we will take a long time to do that.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.900
But let's try it and check what will happen next.

04:02.170 --> 04:11.660
So the network as the same next and we click Finish on you is to have charge computer resource and storage

04:12.040 --> 04:16.240
of our the virtual machine VM 7 to do it.

04:16.250 --> 04:20.890
I do know that all of us need a minute for the past or number one.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.190
So this is a long process because it was Windows 7.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.970
It's a large virtual machine.

04:25.970 --> 04:31.330
It will take more than a how and this is too much time to wait.

04:31.340 --> 04:41.030
So let's just make it simple and we migrated to do land number one or line number two to make it's more

04:41.090 --> 04:41.560
faster.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.200
So the click NEXT NEXT.

04:43.210 --> 04:49.040
So the process that will be happening in the background migrating to storage first from to look at storage

04:49.070 --> 04:49.790
or to E6.

04:49.790 --> 04:55.540
I want to I should it splash they migrated to resouce from E6.

04:55.550 --> 04:56.440
I want to.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.440
Any host country.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.090
External storage or share it.

05:01.100 --> 05:01.720
Storage.

05:01.910 --> 05:10.410
So the click next and finish and the process will work perfectly and the machine will be powered on

05:10.410 --> 05:12.150
without any problem.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.120
So this is the end of this section and we cover it all the different duration of the mission that we

05:20.120 --> 05:22.600
can get in the real environment.

05:22.640 --> 05:29.120
And next we'll discover another future of do theme where we spend to see in the next section.
