WEBVTT

00:01.140 --> 00:05.600
Log in so let's do some real example of the Wii motion.

00:05.790 --> 00:08.570
So as you see here we have three Isak's.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.960
That is I one have two virtual machine one for Windows 7 and second one for the Windows XP.

00:15.960 --> 00:23.220
I will keep using the Windows XP machine because it is a smart machine and that consumer listening is

00:23.220 --> 00:25.690
also because we have limited resource.

00:25.730 --> 00:26.860
Spew on the room.

00:27.060 --> 00:33.490
So to practice that I will do I will do it on Windows XP from time to time I will use the Windows 7

00:33.520 --> 00:38.640
but the Windows 7 will take a lot of time to complete the process.

00:38.640 --> 00:46.190
For example the machine will take about 2 how we do Windows 7 but only one house for Windows XP.

00:46.480 --> 00:54.300
So one of the conditions that we talk about that's due to do the motion for our life machine.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.980
The thing about it a machine you should have the body of this machine in our shared stories.

01:01.130 --> 01:08.130
So if we checked storage of these Windows XP right hand you would see that we used a local storage do

01:08.210 --> 01:10.360
that are store number of years.

01:10.730 --> 01:11.510
That's me.

01:11.510 --> 01:20.020
We're going to get an issue of do the motion for about it on your machine.

01:20.020 --> 01:26.070
So to run our mission inside this machine that's mean we want to migrate this machine from.

01:26.140 --> 01:28.410
E6 I want to.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.590
Art is in a slightly different technique to do that.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.840
So one of them is to drag and drop.

01:34.870 --> 01:41.410
It's simple drag and drop the machine into other holes that you want to begin a tweet or.

01:41.680 --> 01:50.470
Right click on choose migrate from here or even from display to migrate like that and you will have

01:50.470 --> 01:52.500
the option to migrate.

01:52.750 --> 01:59.380
So the first option of the computer restores all the McGreal the virtual machine to another Hulst or

01:59.470 --> 02:00.580
cluster.

02:00.580 --> 02:08.590
So this is simple the solution as we see into preview video when we migrate only the brain of the virtual

02:08.590 --> 02:08.910
machine.

02:08.920 --> 02:14.830
That's mean to CTU and drame we have changed storage only.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.520
That's mean.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.550
Do storage.

02:17.600 --> 02:25.210
The second option that we have is storage the emotion migrate to between machine stodge to a that are

02:25.210 --> 02:32.490
store or datastore Gloucester to account but even that's mean a star that's compatible we do storage

02:32.530 --> 02:34.960
of this virtual machine.

02:35.070 --> 02:42.970
Then we have to change both the computers lose the storage that mean the motion and to the motion at

02:42.970 --> 02:43.820
the same time.

02:44.020 --> 02:51.090
But of course do this fear does not do it at the same time he do the first one they ran the stick and

02:51.090 --> 02:54.200
the one as you say is the next computer resource Fuerth.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.810
All so then select storage first.

02:58.150 --> 02:59.850
It's not important for the order.

03:00.050 --> 03:03.320
It's just to chose one or the sig or the other.

03:03.460 --> 03:09.060
But in the background he make great resouce that's mean.

03:09.190 --> 03:14.480
The motion then migrate do store hours that's mean to storage the motion.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.400
He do it one by one.

03:18.400 --> 03:27.400
So if we try to migrate this machine one of the issues that can happen to you is when you have a device

03:27.400 --> 03:29.860
connected to this machine.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.430
So if you're right next.

03:31.440 --> 03:40.420
For example like that let's just make it simple on chals computer resource all the next.

03:40.450 --> 03:46.930
Then into Silex resouce we have only one host available that's me.

03:47.180 --> 03:51.640
We can't migrate this machine to the other host.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.380
That's me.

03:52.390 --> 03:57.390
We do not have any information right here we can't check the other host.

03:57.410 --> 03:58.120
Why.

03:58.130 --> 04:06.070
Because we use mass transit and we have another problem about the connected device.

04:06.080 --> 04:15.300
So we went back and chose storage on the head it's sure to migrate to another storage outside the same

04:15.470 --> 04:16.330
host.

04:16.350 --> 04:18.800
So this is not an option that we want.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.210
We want to migrate this machine from this host to another host.

04:22.290 --> 04:25.310
So let's try to drag on top like that.

04:26.800 --> 04:34.490
And we chose next if we chose a computer resource for example the second what you see a problem right

04:34.490 --> 04:43.070
here currently connected device City DVD drive what use back in the amp etc. which is not accessible.

04:43.360 --> 04:50.070
And logically If you migrate a machine that's comic Joe for example a cd dvd driver inside the house

04:50.160 --> 05:00.850
one inside E6 one from the E6 I took this machine can't read the content of the CD driver inside E6

05:00.910 --> 05:02.100
I want this.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.070
Oh Ill give it another.

05:04.210 --> 05:13.090
Also if you have a use being connected to this host and this machine is yes be came from this machine.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.170
It can't read this.

05:15.190 --> 05:15.700
Yes.

05:15.790 --> 05:20.290
From the second host of the terHorst So all the hosts have a problem.

05:20.710 --> 05:28.270
If we chose the photos it's OK because it's still connected with same device or the external one.

05:28.300 --> 05:35.680
So for that we need to disconnect any CD DVD driver as you will see ahead City DVD connected to host

05:35.770 --> 05:37.200
Sidorov device.

05:37.240 --> 05:44.880
So we need to disconnect the host is one of the issues that we can get from the motion.

05:45.160 --> 05:52.490
So you need to disconnect any device connected to this machine before doing the mission.

05:52.550 --> 05:55.250
So here you can check out the device for example.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.960
Yes be connected to this machine.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.340
You will see right here a green button.

06:00.340 --> 06:00.830
That's me.

06:00.830 --> 06:09.760
This one is connected to us or our car or any other device connected directly to this machine.

06:10.640 --> 06:19.850
So then if we try to migrate it again no we'll have another option like that.

06:19.850 --> 06:26.060
So no we can't migrate this machine to the host number to order the host number treat.

06:26.060 --> 06:26.560
Why.

06:26.660 --> 06:34.650
Because we chose both option we chose do both computer and storage.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.590
So we do not have any problem.

06:36.590 --> 06:47.070
Now we can't migrate this machine from the storage and from due resource but in another case if we try

06:47.070 --> 06:54.550
to do stories of course it will work because we want to change the stars from that store to us.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.190
And it's not it's work perfectly as you wish you had compatible chip.

06:58.200 --> 06:58.710
Yes.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.270
Yes.

07:00.450 --> 07:07.480
But if we try to do computer restores all only for this machine that is powered on and used the low

07:07.480 --> 07:14.330
cost of the Holston them but what if we click Next you will get an error.

07:14.530 --> 07:22.540
There are compatibility issues that need you attention and you see only one is available that can use

07:22.540 --> 07:32.170
this machine and we still have not any motion yet so we can't migrate a machine without having the data

07:32.380 --> 07:35.400
of this machine in our shed it's dark.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.220
So we click as.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.310
So I know we have one requirement is not available.

07:41.560 --> 07:51.190
We have the motion configuration already we have to shut its doors but this vitrine machine is not used.

07:51.220 --> 08:00.370
Shit it's not as if we chicken I use only do that Bastar but in another case if we try to move a virtual

08:00.370 --> 08:08.320
machine that is bolted on to another host and we try to chose the computer resouce of course the same

08:08.320 --> 08:15.250
problem would be where we can't see any other host because it is in a local store.

08:17.140 --> 08:28.500
So to do that we need to migrate do storage of this machine from a local store to a shithead store.

08:28.540 --> 08:29.830
So let's try to do.

08:29.860 --> 08:35.400
Do look at that store before we'll be able to challenge do computer resources.

08:35.580 --> 08:44.650
So if we chose storage only Next no we're going to see the data stored and the associated storage and

08:44.650 --> 08:53.170
we can't see past all of the hard number two or number three only do that sort of the E6 I want and

08:53.170 --> 08:54.690
then do it.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.780
So we click on that compatible check.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.130
Last one.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.650
OK.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.560
It's OK.

09:01.720 --> 09:06.910
So let's trolls for example Line 1 and click next.

09:06.910 --> 09:13.090
Of course here we chose some options Tillich's virtual disk format same formats as source.

09:13.180 --> 09:19.360
Then if you want to Chush from then to take provision if you remember this Mushin created with a thin

09:19.480 --> 09:26.950
provision we can take provision lazies then provision Egerton's in wait and then provision.

09:27.400 --> 09:34.170
If you don't know what those options mean is unique to bucketed of preview calls about storage that

09:34.180 --> 09:37.650
will explain take and then provision option.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.520
So it just keep it the same then keep existing in storage.

09:41.660 --> 09:47.040
If you want to change the policy of the stock will keep it as the same next.

09:47.150 --> 09:53.360
Then a quick overview about it then next door option right here.

09:53.620 --> 09:58.510
So this is the machine that is bounded on the Windows XP on its own.

09:58.570 --> 10:05.800
If we try to for example create Dokument and give it some

10:09.450 --> 10:24.390
like thats and low on this is our best storage the way Zen like that lets me I use it is this machine.

10:24.590 --> 10:31.940
And you as an administrator you want to make great story out of this machine to a shared storage but

10:31.970 --> 10:35.180
do it keep using virtual machine.

10:35.210 --> 10:43.730
So if we click Finish the process of relocating between machine and migrating from the local storage

10:43.790 --> 10:49.800
external storage and do user will keep using the machine without any problem.

10:49.830 --> 10:50.840
See right here.

10:51.610 --> 10:58.970
The machines still run without any problem and do migration work perfectly without any problem.

11:01.880 --> 11:15.530
Do use the round at your machine without any problem just like that.

11:15.530 --> 11:21.710
Of course it will take a little time and that's why I use Windows XP because it's constant only less

11:21.710 --> 11:22.800
than 1 gigabyte.

11:22.990 --> 11:28.310
But I do Windows 7 have about 4 or 5 Jacobites of that.

11:28.670 --> 11:33.640
So let's give it a little time and we'd be back later.

11:33.650 --> 11:34.890
So how does it do.

11:34.960 --> 11:42.110
Relocate a virtual machine complete 60 steeply and the vitriol machines didn't work without any problems.

11:42.260 --> 11:49.370
So if you go back to the virtual machine and check to start you will see it save interline one and not

11:49.370 --> 11:58.640
into the store locale of the Isak's like so next we'll see the different option of the cmd and ex-Beatle.
