Hello again.

00:01.770 --> 00:09.330
So if you remember when we try to migrate a machine that is a local start of a host and want to use

00:09.330 --> 00:15.710
the emotion only you get an error message and you don't see any other.

00:15.740 --> 00:23.390
Yes I Haast But no when we use our virtual machine that use an external or a shedid splash and try to

00:23.390 --> 00:26.490
migrate to our machine right there.

00:26.740 --> 00:27.240
No.

00:27.270 --> 00:32.730
If we chose to change the computer resource only that information and click next.

00:32.760 --> 00:39.220
No you will see all the different Holst's that is available to Magri traits.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.800
So if we check out number three compatible check successfully.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.610
Number two is number one.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.560
That's it.

00:46.160 --> 00:52.230
Also if you want to migrate a victory machine from a cluster to another cluster we simply click on the

00:52.230 --> 00:54.720
cluster and we check the different cluster.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.140
Right.

00:55.150 --> 00:57.960
Then of course we to see the cluster later.

00:58.290 --> 01:05.110
But no we work on the House level all day and decem will be for the cluster.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.090
So if we chose any of those hosts the compatibility is sexy.

01:11.670 --> 01:20.130
That's mean we can migrate this machine from the resource of Isak's I want to do Tressel's of the E6

01:20.490 --> 01:29.940
2 and 3 of course all those E6 I should be able to read do shit storage that have this Vertretung machine

01:29.970 --> 01:30.570
inside it.

01:30.570 --> 01:33.370
That's mean the last one and this condition is really over.

01:33.600 --> 01:42.420
So it shows he asks I'm number two we click next then we choose the VM in its work destination.

01:42.450 --> 01:42.830
That's me.

01:42.840 --> 01:50.080
This machine connected to a VM network to host one and will be migrated to do them and it will work.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.860
It's the same name that's me.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.600
The other has to have the same name.

01:53.700 --> 01:59.630
If we have any other VM network that's not part group for your machine.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.560
You will see a list of the different parts going to write and then you pick up a new one and check the

02:04.560 --> 02:07.580
compatibility with that one.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.610
So this is another thing.

02:10.770 --> 02:16.560
We migrate the machine from the minute walk to another theme network.

02:16.560 --> 02:24.490
So we click next day we have option to schedule when we shine with highest priority on.

02:24.740 --> 02:25.490
That's me.

02:26.650 --> 02:36.990
Is the height resouce of the spew of this environment or is that center to do.

02:37.030 --> 02:37.580
That's me.

02:37.640 --> 02:46.510
Give priority to this task to migrate this machine from the host Isak's I wan to the host Isak's I talk

02:47.520 --> 02:53.230
so much in reserve hides spews Gillooly a preference relative to normal priority migration.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.420
The mission of my complaint more quickly and do skiddoo regular motion.

02:59.580 --> 03:05.140
Reserves that lower Skibbereen preference relative to hide the migration.

03:05.140 --> 03:11.230
You can extend the mission duration so as we have a simple log we don't have any problem.

03:11.440 --> 03:18.270
And of course information about the risk of migration if you have some problem we is X I number but

03:18.280 --> 03:23.830
what I do want to begin is other other machines other host you need to use the highest priority to do

03:23.830 --> 03:28.090
the job before any problem happen to do house number one.

03:28.090 --> 03:34.840
So if we click next to seat option a quick view challenge computer resouce leave him on the original

03:34.930 --> 03:36.070
storage.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.260
That's a quick idea.

03:37.270 --> 03:38.060
That's me.

03:38.070 --> 03:44.260
We do the motion of the resource of the brain of the virtual machine that can win xp.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.270
And before then the host destination is Isak's.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.970
I can but talk network network with a.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.520
That's me.

03:52.570 --> 03:54.380
We don't change anything from them.

03:54.390 --> 03:57.520
It's what an emotion is right.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.310
So we click Finish Let's see.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.040
That's me.

04:01.150 --> 04:08.210
We still have the machine about it on the machine still work better.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.190
They.

04:11.230 --> 04:14.800
If we run the machine like that.

04:14.810 --> 04:17.910
We see that the machine still work without any problem.

04:18.440 --> 04:27.940
And when you see it will go faster than the storage because the stores move all the data.

04:28.030 --> 04:35.390
But no it's only more resource so well wait onto the end of it.

04:35.630 --> 04:39.250
So as you see the virtual machines still work perfectly.

04:39.260 --> 04:39.780
No.

04:39.800 --> 04:47.760
As you see we have the same back and do mission accomplished successfully.

04:47.860 --> 04:53.740
So you back right here you see Windows XP gone from Isak's.

04:53.860 --> 04:59.430
I wonder if we checked is excite you will see that we have to win xp still.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.630
Power it on inside is.

05:01.630 --> 05:06.680
I number two perfectly.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.540
So next we'll see.

05:08.620 --> 05:14.520
Another the motion of the stars and the resource.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.220
So soon the next.
