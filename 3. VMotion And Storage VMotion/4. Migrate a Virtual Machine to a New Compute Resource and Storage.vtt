00:01.960 --> 00:02.840
Blogging.

00:02.940 --> 00:08.110
So let's do the motion for both the process and the stars.

00:08.220 --> 00:10.490
And this option will take more time.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.230
But it's not a problem.

00:12.390 --> 00:18.240
So we'll do it for the same virtual machine that is bolted on because all the other machines used do

00:18.540 --> 00:23.250
look all that that's mean we can't do the motion of the research.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.990
So they just keep working on this machine.

00:26.070 --> 00:35.450
So a click on we chose migrate and no we weren't trolls but computer resource and storage.

00:35.710 --> 00:41.940
So we click next and we go into the opposite direction that's when we want to migrate this machine from

00:42.030 --> 00:42.450
is x.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.220
I host Isak's I won.

00:45.340 --> 00:51.580
So we chose the data center we chose the destination of quarter number three it's compatibles the number

00:51.580 --> 00:53.310
one Azo it's competition.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.020
So it click next.

00:56.020 --> 01:01.750
Then we chose the styles that we want to migrate from this vitrine machine.

01:01.750 --> 01:06.220
It started on last one that we want to migrated to do land too.

01:06.430 --> 01:09.260
But let's try to get it to do that astore.

01:09.310 --> 01:15.190
Number two if we chose Number two like that okay.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.730
Next day the network next then we should hide.

01:22.190 --> 01:30.120
How are we going to migrate it to do that store or do I host a burrito.

01:30.170 --> 01:30.690
That's me.

01:30.710 --> 01:36.070
We can migrate from a shitty storage to a low cost of the holes that we chose.

01:36.350 --> 01:43.520
If we go back again and chose we're not Marty as the same no we'd see we have the post-war one and not

01:43.670 --> 01:50.240
a store number two because the holes in them but we have access to store number one.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.390
So that's why you should care about the low cost.

01:54.410 --> 02:02.300
If we chose one you will see the store number two and not the store number one.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.400
So let's just agree to that.

02:04.550 --> 02:09.920
I won then of course we're not going to look out the store because all the future that we're going to

02:09.990 --> 02:12.690
use need to have a shedded store.

02:13.010 --> 02:17.430
The virtual machine should be stored in a shed installed and not in a lockout.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.810
So we chose not to.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.540
If you remember this machine started into line 1.

02:22.600 --> 02:28.190
So we wanted to do large numbers drop the next day in the VM network.

02:28.190 --> 02:35.480
Of course you can choose any network available and check the compatibility next then skiddoo ventilation

02:35.710 --> 02:36.750
hide.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.800
It's an oxygen machine.

02:42.290 --> 02:51.050
Storage the motion and resouce the motion.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.350
So we click next.

02:54.620 --> 03:02.570
And a quick overview shows the computer resource and storage to the host is exciting but one non-network

03:02.570 --> 03:08.760
assignment to do is learn to same formats as source.

03:08.870 --> 03:16.430
So a quick finish and storage of the emotion will start to and the machine will keep working without

03:16.490 --> 03:17.610
any problem.

03:17.630 --> 03:24.020
So the process I take and do machine work particularly at low

03:27.530 --> 03:34.620
this emotion will take more time as we did into Preview one when we began to do this.

03:34.740 --> 03:46.510
It's need time to copy and past the top out of storage to other external or shete So also we can run

03:46.540 --> 03:51.190
a sig and at the same when we do the work.

03:51.190 --> 03:57.630
So for example we want to migrate this one to the migration from the start.

03:57.650 --> 04:00.830
If you see right here it used to look at the passport.

04:01.120 --> 04:09.750
Of course we can't change the computer resource we see it right here a problem because it only showed

04:09.760 --> 04:13.460
the easiest enough but we can't migrated to done any other easy.

04:13.810 --> 04:22.420
If we chose to channel the stars on the next then we chose to share that storage plan.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.540
Number one it's ok.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.970
Compatible next then finished.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.070
And this is about it on your machine.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.100
McGroarty.

04:32.460 --> 04:41.320
Shit it's trash and do powered on or a life machine migrated to another E6 I without any problem.

04:41.330 --> 04:47.590
So this process will take a little time so I will see you later at the end of the process and we check.

04:47.630 --> 04:51.580
Do you change so.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.140
Or is it the Windows XP.

04:54.160 --> 05:01.600
Number five become in the line storage that brilliant and Windows XP that is bolted on.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.380
No its in the number two.

05:04.630 --> 05:09.520
And of course the machine still bolted on without any problem.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.320
So if we go to the store and try to check the difference barrage brings up that to stop us to run and

05:17.690 --> 05:26.490
check the virtual machine using this one is empty because Windows must have ANY think inside this one

05:26.530 --> 05:29.040
have your machine do when center.

05:29.420 --> 05:32.490
But this is the one that I use for a decent answer.

05:32.770 --> 05:35.570
Then do the Windows XP basics.

05:36.020 --> 05:41.940
Number two is empty have a Windows 7 abroad but we still not touch it yet.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.020
Then learn one have Windows XP.

05:45.110 --> 05:48.040
Then I plan to have Windows XP.

05:48.070 --> 05:49.210
Number four.

05:49.390 --> 05:59.450
Of course if we browse the content fight you will see us define migrating to do lot number two etc

06:02.470 --> 06:13.680
so you see the Windows XP right there and all five of this machine migrated to the line number so all

06:14.030 --> 06:17.320
fired the migrated to number two.

06:17.410 --> 06:23.430
And for the love number one at the top a Windows XP number five.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.340
We'll be right there.

06:27.310 --> 06:30.380
So click on it like that.

06:30.430 --> 06:33.460
We see the Delphi migrated to this house.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.210
That is part of if you remember about it.

06:36.220 --> 06:44.590
All machines have more files uploaded of Mushin have less 5 deemed decie of the harddrive and the other

06:44.970 --> 06:45.850
five.

06:46.270 --> 06:47.780
So the next read your.
