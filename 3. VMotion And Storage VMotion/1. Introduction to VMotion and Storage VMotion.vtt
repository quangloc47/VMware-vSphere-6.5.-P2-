00:00.530 --> 00:04.370
Hello and welcome into this new section about the

00:07.530 --> 00:12.390
as we see in the preview section we create our shared.

00:12.450 --> 00:17.840
And this is our requirement step to discover the other future of the world.

00:17.880 --> 00:24.250
And one of them is do the motion so let's discover the motion.

00:24.270 --> 00:30.640
So we have to kind of the emotion we have a simple emotion and distort the motion.

00:31.690 --> 00:37.180
So what is do simple the emotion or simply the motion.

00:37.360 --> 00:46.910
So the motion is me great are getting your machine from a host to another host and the opposite from

00:46.920 --> 00:50.360
the second host to do first hosts.

00:50.430 --> 00:51.120
That's nice.

00:51.270 --> 00:58.740
For example here we have a house number one and number two when we use the view we pick up this virtual

00:58.740 --> 01:00.690
machine our life virtual machine.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.400
That's me.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.370
This machine is bounded on.

01:03.390 --> 01:05.520
And we make great.

01:05.820 --> 01:12.840
That's the right expression is to me get to this virtual machine to do SIGINT host for any reason for

01:12.840 --> 01:15.230
example less resource in this house.

01:15.240 --> 01:22.730
You want to move it to the other holes you want to put up this house for another kind of service you'll

01:22.760 --> 01:29.890
need to migrate this machine from this house to another house in your data center to keep using it.

01:30.030 --> 01:36.790
There are lots of situations that you need to integrate a virtual machine from a house to another house.

01:36.940 --> 01:40.710
So this is the function of the machine.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.430
Migrate this virtual machine that is powered on.

01:43.620 --> 01:50.280
That's me in the service or the application is it in this virtual machine will still use it without

01:50.340 --> 01:51.830
any problem.

01:51.960 --> 01:58.920
Drawbars the process of moving this virtual machine from this house to another house and this is one

01:58.920 --> 02:04.180
of the heights of ability function of the the motion.

02:04.410 --> 02:11.720
So next door of the emotion we need some condition to do that.

02:11.760 --> 02:19.140
The first one that we need is to the mission network config that's meant you need to have a configuration

02:19.770 --> 02:23.550
for the different tools to do the motion.

02:23.580 --> 02:31.740
If you remember in our preview section when we rebuild our home lab right there in the house Number

02:31.740 --> 02:39.500
one we create the mission we do V.M. Carmel EPEAT 1 10.

02:39.660 --> 02:44.890
If we check right now you will see that we enable do the motion service.

02:44.890 --> 02:52.100
You see this VM can and what you did for the mission service we enable it click OK.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.090
So we have the mission enabled in this host.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.300
Then we do the same thing for the husband but two.

02:58.430 --> 03:05.960
Number three all the host showed how the motion enabled it in one of the VM.

03:06.390 --> 03:12.640
And we give it to a network adapter to have redundancy.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.770
Like you said.

03:14.900 --> 03:21.760
So this has to have the emotion will be able to execute the emotion inside it.

03:21.830 --> 03:29.480
If we have another house that does not have the emotion inside it we can't run motion with that's.

03:29.900 --> 03:36.160
So we need to make our network config for the ventilation traffic.

03:36.170 --> 03:39.410
We did that in the previous section.

03:39.410 --> 03:44.840
Then of course we need to have at least one virtual machine inside the host because the ventilation

03:45.320 --> 03:46.970
work on a virtual machine.

03:46.970 --> 03:56.000
So we need to have our virtual machine inside a house that we want to migrated so as you see here and

03:56.010 --> 04:02.230
then we want to make grades of this machine from these hoes to other hosts.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.660
So we do the motion traffic.

04:05.840 --> 04:14.640
The second requirement that we need is to have ah Sherrod Stosh let's me Strozzi connected to the house

04:15.180 --> 04:21.870
number one and to host them back to the house the top the virtual machine and the host that will get

04:21.960 --> 04:24.160
the virtual machine inside.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.440
That's mean shifts.

04:26.670 --> 04:34.710
And of course the most important heard of it by using a shared interest is that the data of this virtual

04:34.710 --> 04:41.230
machine should be stored in the shedded store and not in the local storage.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.800
That's why we need assurance.

04:42.830 --> 04:49.430
If we do drop out of this virtual machine that's mean the hard drive or an operating system etc. all

04:49.430 --> 04:55.240
the data on this virtual machine should be saved in external storage.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.600
That's mean to shed its trash.

04:57.620 --> 04:58.210
That's me.

04:58.250 --> 05:04.100
The body of this virtual machine and debatin only That's it in the house.

05:04.130 --> 05:07.820
That's me in a virtual machine have a brain and a body.

05:07.820 --> 05:11.030
The brain is the Sibiu and the brain.

05:11.180 --> 05:19.790
They use it from the host and the body is split into shaded storage.

05:19.790 --> 05:27.130
This is one of the condition of the machine the virtual machine should have a sieve it insisted it was

05:27.380 --> 05:30.040
and you will see why we need this condition.

05:30.050 --> 05:40.700
So then after the shedded straws we need to have similar Sippy family but I mean the hosts and br1 and

05:40.730 --> 05:49.070
hosts and Budlong that will get Division machine should have similar Sibiu family as we know a virtual

05:49.070 --> 05:54.470
machine or any operating system astonied in our laptop or our desktop.

05:54.470 --> 06:04.820
When you change Sibiu the operations then need to update the driver of the new.

06:04.850 --> 06:12.650
So for that if you migrate a virtual machine with this spew for example and to a modern machine that

06:12.710 --> 06:15.360
is different you will have a problem.

06:15.370 --> 06:24.110
Our pension system can't detect it do not see you need to update the driver in need to reboot to detect

06:24.170 --> 06:27.270
it and work with the process.

06:27.280 --> 06:33.100
For example some C.P. have different proses all spew at work with the process.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.600
Didn't you have your process for example.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.090
Is this machine.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.390
Is this typical of the 64 bit.

06:42.410 --> 06:49.190
And then the other hosts have only to do this of course it is impossible to have a 32 bit inside the

06:49.190 --> 06:55.700
house that the is X but just an example to get an idea if you're McGeary it's a virtual machine from

06:55.760 --> 07:04.580
a few of the 64 bit and operating system have 64 bits inside a Sibiu that's only stewpot the 32 bits.

07:04.610 --> 07:07.820
This machine will not going to work.

07:07.970 --> 07:15.100
That's why we need to have a similar Sibiu a family can always come on the moderate whiteman's but to

07:15.210 --> 07:17.000
have the same model.

07:17.310 --> 07:25.340
For example Intel if I live in this host are social and other hosts have an Intel 4:58 or Xian seven

07:25.460 --> 07:34.300
or eight shawled the host should have the same 0 8 version but of course it's not a requirement.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.850
It just are commanded to have the same model.

07:36.980 --> 07:44.350
But we should have the same family that's me if I use Ghazwan right here should have zijn stupid.

07:44.390 --> 07:47.890
Right there is and then C.P right.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.610
The other host should have also an intent or I am ET.

07:54.050 --> 07:59.700
So the same C.P for me but for different model.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.060
We have a service of the VM and work on it.

08:02.060 --> 08:12.920
E vc that's inherited the machine that will balance it between the different models and lets the virtual

08:12.920 --> 08:20.210
machine migrated from the host want to host to without any problem and use this other spew even in a

08:20.210 --> 08:23.720
different model or at different speed etc..

08:24.920 --> 08:32.810
So this is due to a simple notion of the machine when you have all this equipment then you can migrate

08:32.900 --> 08:38.690
the vitriol machine from the host weren't to the house number two perfectly.

08:39.050 --> 08:46.190
And of course this machine will keep powered on without any problem and all your service will be available

08:46.220 --> 08:48.400
without any problem.

08:48.410 --> 08:55.460
So there we have the second kind of thing we shouldn't is storage the mission the mission is a simple

08:56.300 --> 09:02.010
process but to me human grace only do storage of two virtual machine.

09:02.390 --> 09:08.150
And as I said you're one of the requirements is that the virtual machine should have the data stored

09:08.150 --> 09:15.890
in our shared storage and estimates but not in the McAllister's then the storage room we think will

09:15.890 --> 09:21.760
be great that all of this virtual machine from the storage number what to do storage.

09:21.810 --> 09:27.630
Number two and the machine will keep about it on without any problem.

09:27.710 --> 09:35.420
Of course we have another kind of storage machine that's called the motion that's me the virtual machine

09:35.870 --> 09:37.270
is bolted off.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.290
Then you do the migration without any problem.

09:40.340 --> 09:44.020
And in this case it's not a requirement to have a straight it's.

09:44.240 --> 09:50.860
You can do it even from the local splodge you migrated from the local stores to a shared.

09:51.110 --> 09:55.490
Then another local store without any problem.

09:55.520 --> 10:03.230
So this is a defendant's valuation available in VM what will proxies do step in the next Vaduz and we'll

10:03.230 --> 10:06.180
discover more about the motion.

10:06.190 --> 10:06.910
So the next.
