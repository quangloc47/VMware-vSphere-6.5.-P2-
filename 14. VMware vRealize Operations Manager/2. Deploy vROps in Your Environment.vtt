00:01.610 --> 00:02.320
Blogging.

00:02.600 --> 00:09.730
So the first tank you need to know about the ropes is that David is an operation system.

00:09.730 --> 00:15.210
It's like on a page insisted on starlight in our virtual machine in your environment.

00:15.210 --> 00:19.470
Then those verbs will start tracking our environment.

00:19.740 --> 00:22.670
After connecting to do the center server.

00:22.770 --> 00:28.210
So how you deploy your crops in your environment.

00:28.260 --> 00:36.690
So from the center server you can go to home and in the home you have a tape call it VERY is Operation

00:36.690 --> 00:42.070
management and there you have the bezique task deploy various operation management.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.760
Of course there are some of the very place like a very somber edition that's come with the recent observer

00:49.090 --> 00:53.160
give you as much information like only to talk about your environment.

00:53.160 --> 01:02.610
Didn't we have a moderate version that lets you to automate the task and let's do is make the change

01:02.610 --> 01:03.960
necessary for that environment.

01:04.140 --> 01:09.870
Like for example upgrading to round of the virtual machine or the speed of the vision machine or resize

01:09.890 --> 01:18.870
defy and make great strides from land to land etc. it's responsible for managing your environment to

01:18.870 --> 01:20.950
be in a healthy state.

01:20.970 --> 01:26.550
For example a virtual machine needs more space he will automatically add a space to disparage and Arsal

01:26.580 --> 01:28.350
during the sleep you do.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.670
Network gets it way.

01:29.880 --> 01:36.890
So it make the necessary change automatically if you chose to do it automatically.

01:37.170 --> 01:42.730
So you simply click on deploy Vili's management and other.

01:43.030 --> 01:51.420
If your plates of the very is that you need to download it before you put it and all from the Lacamp

01:51.750 --> 01:57.070
click browser and chose do Virial is fine.

01:57.270 --> 02:03.760
Then of course Drogo the process it will help Pugil config and your virtual machine.

02:03.860 --> 02:08.790
Select the name and the location that's mean name or the virtual machine that will have the avi in place

02:08.820 --> 02:16.040
of the video is the location that mean any host or any of that that's under CLX are resource.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.230
Mean you'd give it a different sort of call where automatically chose the research necessary from the

02:21.670 --> 02:23.570
file review.

02:23.660 --> 02:31.440
Still a stranger to the stars or this virtual machine didn't really tour complete deployment of course

02:31.770 --> 02:37.770
you need to know the requirement from the realease operation management.

02:37.800 --> 02:44.140
So if you got hurt you'll see some early operations management windows virtual Scipion memory and equipment.

02:44.370 --> 02:49.020
So it's where it requires some resouce information about your environments.

02:49.020 --> 02:54.280
So for example if you have an extra smart environment that's mean a tiny environment that we chose.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.260
The attention to be center server.

02:56.460 --> 03:03.000
It will require to have two virtual spew and a gigabyte of rent if you have a smart environment.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.380
You need for Super you 16 gigabyte of RAM and so on and so on.

03:07.380 --> 03:14.460
So this is the requirement of the environment but you don't need to care about them because drug deployment

03:14.710 --> 03:19.800
of a virtual machine it will automatically select the necessary hardware for it.

03:19.860 --> 03:24.930
You just need to have enough resources to deploy this virtual machine.

03:24.930 --> 03:30.950
You can get about enough resource that you need if you have extra small you need at least a gigabytes.

03:31.050 --> 03:37.520
And if you have a large environment you need 16 virtual subpoena and forty eight as you go by it or

03:37.540 --> 03:39.290
from.

03:39.370 --> 03:47.330
So then you we need to download if you want to try to place in your home lab environment that's mean

03:47.380 --> 03:53.650
if you have more resource in your environment to start on your virtual machine with a gigabyte and so

03:53.650 --> 03:54.380
on and so on.

03:54.550 --> 04:02.890
You can go to the VM where and of course with your trial version you can download VM we're very pleased

04:03.160 --> 04:04.340
with standard edition.

04:04.370 --> 04:10.990
Evolution of course evolution give you a version then to download the same step you.

04:11.010 --> 04:14.770
So the activity is operational management appliance and stagnation.

04:14.770 --> 04:17.870
You click money you download and start downloading.

04:17.890 --> 04:26.640
Of course there are some other team like LOEG and business for Claude So this is a stick to deploy your

04:27.070 --> 04:34.680
reality is the same I had only had to add the template of the FBI is the same.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.000
This is a step without having to get in.

04:38.190 --> 04:43.720
Page staff's busy sometimes do not show up for example like that

04:47.110 --> 04:50.500
show are getting stopped and clothes are getting stuck.

04:53.130 --> 04:59.580
So you deploy your first virtual machine and install the props in your environment.
