00:02.090 --> 00:03.070
Hello again.

00:03.420 --> 00:10.540
So let's just get our quick overview about Rops the latest vission other apps available from the Wii

00:10.550 --> 00:13.400
and we're in our hands on love.

00:13.500 --> 00:19.140
If you remember the hand on love is do all line a lot of it have from the VM where that leads you to

00:19.620 --> 00:23.550
test the different software of the VM work.

00:23.580 --> 00:32.310
So when you log into the ropes as it drops that carpet to lock on in our example will be any name that

00:32.310 --> 00:38.560
you give it other very obstinate to the attention that they don't end up when you log in it's asking

00:38.580 --> 00:40.480
for the user and the password.

00:40.710 --> 00:48.810
And when you get inside the ropes after a time of letting the OPs track the data on in that environment

00:49.200 --> 00:50.820
it will give you this overview.

00:50.940 --> 00:55.380
It's not like the ones that we see in the picture but it's almost the same idea.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.500
So it's true.

00:56.580 --> 01:01.380
Complete resource a system that's I mean how much host we have in this.

01:01.390 --> 01:06.220
Now it's three in our example also we use three is my house.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.810
How much virtual machine we have.

01:07.830 --> 01:08.490
It's seven.

01:08.490 --> 01:09.610
How much of that are stored.

01:09.630 --> 01:10.250
It's one.

01:10.260 --> 01:11.500
And so on and so on.

01:11.790 --> 01:14.080
So it shows you the Harolds statue.

01:14.220 --> 01:15.950
It show your art is great.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.360
That's me.

01:16.360 --> 01:22.080
Everything is OK if you have some critical you see the number right there and you will get that suggestion

01:22.210 --> 01:22.980
right.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.830
So does it need to use it in the right environment to start getting it right here.

01:28.830 --> 01:33.430
But as this is just our home lab so everything is work perfectly.

01:33.430 --> 01:36.440
So those not to get any water yet.

01:36.460 --> 01:43.630
So to help state it sure you can tell the water table if you have any problem you see them right there.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.530
They the budget store and give you some reason right there.

01:48.540 --> 01:52.730
Of course you can check the difference halls detected by the ropes.

01:55.780 --> 01:56.990
Then imagery machine.

01:56.990 --> 02:02.600
The State of the difference between what you see right here some information had as it's going to call

02:02.600 --> 02:12.020
this one immediate and this one has warning so up on your virtual hard disk or expand the existing disk

02:12.020 --> 02:13.340
of the virtual machine.

02:14.840 --> 02:22.880
You must first remove Osma before expending an existing disk after completing after completing.

02:22.880 --> 02:30.350
This is our guest OS specific produ to expand the file system on the new or expanded disk.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.700
So it's give you an me that some virtual machine need to expand do a hard disk of the local disk or

02:37.700 --> 02:38.650
dismiss your machine.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.020
So it is his DNA or the virtual machine Webbs 0 1 8.

02:42.130 --> 02:46.750
I'll let one or more virtual machine just my system are running out of disk.

02:46.790 --> 02:52.590
If you remember this example from that picture right there between machine the division and spews.

02:52.790 --> 02:55.160
This one is about disk.

02:55.340 --> 03:02.940
Then the other type virtualization a hybrid is allowed this is a that of the hybrid revisited our super

03:02.950 --> 03:03.650
title.

03:03.710 --> 03:10.380
It's about the capacity and the time then on the hard disk or extent the same one for this one but this

03:10.380 --> 03:12.310
is a bit of warning.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.240
Not at the level of immediate.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.000
This one is overloading.

03:16.040 --> 03:23.490
This one is a little overloading and so on and so on and so of course you get all the details about

03:23.520 --> 03:24.260
her.

03:24.270 --> 03:29.110
For example the store you can store is work perfectly and so on and so on.

03:30.900 --> 03:39.010
We have some overview about the environment how much that we have cluster host virtual machine running

03:39.020 --> 03:44.220
virtual machine and other virtual machine is bolted on part of the Bastar et cetera.

03:44.390 --> 03:52.340
And does it show you all the time or does virtual machine running and our data volume some top 15 virtual

03:52.340 --> 03:56.100
machine experiencing superior concentration.

03:56.150 --> 04:02.370
I mean the virtual machine that's consumed to CPM wants to do with zero to 8 is the one that consume

04:02.850 --> 04:05.150
C.P more than the other one.

04:05.150 --> 04:13.450
The photonics consume less spew then about the virtual machine the database 0 1 8 consume more memory.

04:13.460 --> 04:18.400
Of course the data is always consumed your memory then for the disk.

04:18.470 --> 04:26.990
The DMZ Rwanda web application default on web with Windows then Windows Windows not consume any space

04:27.080 --> 04:30.950
so it is at the lowest of the list.

04:30.950 --> 04:39.250
Some are lower volume Joiada critical to wardman etc. so you need to check those information or read

04:39.250 --> 04:44.530
the content and you will start in distending do different and different option.

04:44.940 --> 04:47.010
So the same about the environment.

04:47.270 --> 04:51.030
The use of the virtual etc..

04:52.410 --> 04:54.240
So there are a lot lot of information.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.160
Of course you can check the other tools for example for the virtual Sandt.
