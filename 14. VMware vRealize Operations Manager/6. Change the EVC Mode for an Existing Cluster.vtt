WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:05.610
So let's talk a little about the AVC more.

00:05.910 --> 00:12.380
So if you remember I told you that when we want to the emotion to hide operability between the different

00:12.710 --> 00:20.040
host we need to have the ABC enable it if we have some different version of the speech.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.670
So that's part of this that is like that

00:27.360 --> 00:28.020
more of.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.170
Yes.

00:29.290 --> 00:36.170
We got to do cluster OVC enable and disable from the cluster.

00:36.410 --> 00:45.490
So we got on feek got them where OVC and we click it it's so hard.

00:45.530 --> 00:53.340
It shows you that it is disable you trolls enable a VC for on the host then it show you all this different

00:53.390 --> 00:57.350
I'm the supported for this Juanda generation 1 2 and 3.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.450
One more of our missions the knowledge base number et cetera.

01:02.810 --> 01:08.820
So it shows you that the compatibility is not compatible with this one because the heart does not always.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.380
I am the CPA.

01:10.580 --> 01:19.040
So if we chose enable a VC for Intel host it show you that is I 1 and 2 is supported for.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.460
VC what and then.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.510
But I three of you know that because we have a part on virtual machine.

01:25.640 --> 01:31.850
So the host cannot be made to the cluster Quran's enhanced via motion compatibility so that we see meaning

01:31.900 --> 01:40.400
in Hence in compatibility mode power on or respond the virtual machine on the host might be using C.P.R.

01:40.400 --> 01:46.940
future he didn't buy that mode but when it took power of his mature machine to be able to use that of

01:46.940 --> 01:48.960
the seat we discussed.

01:49.310 --> 01:55.430
So when I power of these virtual machines of course in my situation I can't do it because this one has

01:55.450 --> 02:02.900
one Saturday the central server so you need to enable this one for your host then you need is the center

02:02.910 --> 02:06.600
set outside of the E6 I host of educed Gloucester

02:09.840 --> 02:19.280
and it should a difference until a supporter of the Vita VC and when you chose to enable a VC for Intel

02:19.280 --> 02:24.810
host and click on it it will enable the ABC model between the different ethics I host.

02:24.860 --> 02:30.100
But I mean it is the comment part of the difference Tippee.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.940
For example if I one have OCP with speed top want 3G go ahead.

02:35.090 --> 02:36.860
This one is ours.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.320
With speed trip want to go ahead.

02:39.450 --> 02:44.400
So we try to use the common point between the different I host.

02:44.570 --> 02:51.650
So in that case when we try to migrate a virtual machine powered on from this host for example here

02:51.780 --> 02:55.880
is freek'n number and speed number of the Sibiu.

02:56.170 --> 03:04.280
It will automatically fan the same frequent number and same speed of value in this house and the same

03:04.280 --> 03:05.400
for this one.

03:05.390 --> 03:12.530
So the virtual machine will be powered on and use the same the current speed or the common value of

03:12.530 --> 03:15.080
the Sibiu between the different Isak's I host.

03:15.110 --> 03:20.410
In that case it will work perfectly if you remember when we try to integrate a virtual machine in front

03:20.420 --> 03:23.230
of it excited to excite it work.

03:23.270 --> 03:29.510
But when we want to migrate to virtual machine from E6 I treat it as I do it give us a narrative because

03:29.540 --> 03:39.250
there are no compatibility between two of the three things I took in that it broke why you do enabled

03:39.400 --> 03:40.820
the VC mode.

03:41.090 --> 03:44.040
But of course you should have the same brand.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.820
If you see right here we have HD and Intel s.p.

03:48.920 --> 03:57.440
So all the CPA we have Ahmed Chalabi tend to be Avatar is of VC mode and if you use Dwight D Ru you

03:57.700 --> 03:59.160
host should use.

03:59.210 --> 04:00.620
I am the CPA.

04:00.830 --> 04:06.100
So you see right there of course we neutralize any of the obviously it's work here.

04:06.330 --> 04:12.800
You see if I am the between the generation 1 and 2 and 3 thats mean you should have the generation 1

04:12.950 --> 04:19.370
2 and 3 to be used obviously more between them if you have for example a generation for it were not

04:19.370 --> 04:23.070
going to work between Generation 4 and Generation 3.

04:23.090 --> 04:31.590
So for that you need to chose generation three to work between Generation 2 and 3 with some other information.

04:31.820 --> 04:40.140
Then for the generation 4 it will support a new generation for the daily driver and deuse steamroller.

04:40.730 --> 04:47.630
So you can check the designs one by one to know which one that you can use in your environments do the

04:47.630 --> 04:58.910
same for Mehram and Del byname no Harlene with Mayor Sandy Bridge and even bridge and so on and of course

04:58.910 --> 05:03.360
in our house does not support the bridge only.

05:03.610 --> 05:09.950
I treat that stewpot see how superior to what is not supported the cluster called in has a could possibly

05:09.950 --> 05:13.190
than one the host luck future rock y right.

05:13.220 --> 05:22.490
Thats more because I want and Isak's I to exist in an old laptop that have our ear 5st Sibiu from the

05:22.560 --> 05:24.580
other generation do it.

05:24.640 --> 05:31.910
I number three exist in this laptop that I use right now that have an ear five if you generation so

05:32.000 --> 05:34.080
it is supported by everybody.

05:34.490 --> 05:41.360
So thats me in my situation I can't nobbled you see between this laptop the city of this laptop and

05:42.110 --> 05:47.540
the other laptop because there are a different version.

05:47.670 --> 05:53.520
It's only supposed to do the same one like this wants to do all the swanned is not supported can't be

05:53.520 --> 06:00.210
other middle class we and forward on the end how the Warshel support the cluster current in has risen.

06:00.330 --> 06:06.930
But some of the C-p in the superficial are missing from the host chicken the host News Corp to ensure

06:06.930 --> 06:10.810
that you have the option sashed DVT.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.290
Yes it's at.

06:13.340 --> 06:19.890
So this is true of AVC in need to enable AIDS if you have some small difference between the different

06:20.630 --> 06:21.420
hosts.

06:21.800 --> 06:27.010
We have a policy fusion engine one and an in any two in a mode of speed.

06:27.080 --> 06:32.000
You need to enable this one of course you need to power off all your E6.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.370
Are you a virtual machine to be able to do with not every virtual machine but some of them some of that

06:39.380 --> 06:43.080
you will get is unique to part of the virtual machine.

06:43.160 --> 06:49.220
I mean you need to reboot the virtual machine to get to do new stitching of the c.p.

06:49.730 --> 06:55.450
So this is the idea of VC of course in my example we can't use it because we have the virtual machines

06:55.460 --> 06:57.550
that have the center server about it.

06:57.630 --> 07:03.260
It excites me and it is impossible to do it in this lup.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.650
So this is the idea of a PC.

07:05.900 --> 07:13.940
And next we'll try to conclude discours Mike over in the last information that you need to complete

07:13.940 --> 07:16.800
your experience knowledge.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.980
So the next section.
