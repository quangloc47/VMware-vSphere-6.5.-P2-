Hello and welcome again in this new section that's we'll going to talk a little about do the ropes or

00:07.550 --> 00:16.900
collect the relays is Operation management in distinction we're going to talk a little about this tool

00:17.270 --> 00:25.220
and we're not going to cover the details about it because this tune need a fall your calls about it

00:25.280 --> 00:28.000
because it's not a smart tool that you can use it.

00:28.100 --> 00:33.220
It's a very interesting tool that you can use it in your environment.

00:33.230 --> 00:37.820
So the first Let's discover what do ops is.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.530
So we go to home here.

00:40.850 --> 00:44.090
And of course we have this icon high tech.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.900
It's a very nice operation management.

00:47.270 --> 00:54.100
If you remember when we tried to download the center server we have two option centers server and the

00:54.120 --> 00:56.850
center server with Operation management.

00:56.870 --> 00:59.550
So the operation management is very solid.

00:59.570 --> 01:04.300
It's a smaller version of the operations management.

01:04.410 --> 01:16.110
So this will help you to monitor your environment and detect any data any problem Arcel make any necessary

01:16.110 --> 01:18.730
change automatically or manually.

01:18.780 --> 01:19.780
And so on and so on.

01:19.800 --> 01:25.980
It's a very important tool and it is always sort of common that if we have our important environment

01:26.400 --> 01:34.110
that's have for example six or seven Haast if you have less than six hosts It's not deserve to have

01:34.390 --> 01:40.650
drops in your lap because you have a small environment you can monitor your environment manually when

01:40.680 --> 01:44.180
you have more than six hosts.

01:44.550 --> 01:52.260
It is recommended to install do drops in your environment to start tracking everything in your environment.

01:52.530 --> 01:59.130
So the video his operations manager collect performance that upfront ish objects at every level of your

01:59.130 --> 02:05.230
virtual environment from individual virtual machines and disk driver into a cluster and data center

02:05.520 --> 02:11.580
It's store and analyze the data and use data analysis to provide real time information about the problem

02:11.670 --> 02:16.860
or potential problem anywhere in your virtual environment.

02:16.860 --> 02:20.570
So this is the benefits of release operation of management.

02:20.640 --> 02:28.210
It's help you to track everything in your environment and detect if there are any problem any overloading
