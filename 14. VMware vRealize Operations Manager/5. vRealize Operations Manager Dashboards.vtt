Her show you some example you don't see why we should between watching have to hide stupid.

00:08.030 --> 00:11.490
I'd start as input output and latency.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.210
So you click on this one too.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.470
That story has a review host user's overview.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.790
Don't you wish Haast have the highest speed.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.990
So you click on it it shows you the difference.

00:22.010 --> 00:29.450
Has that cost you the difference if you consume more active memory and so on and so on.

00:29.450 --> 00:35.780
So there are a lot lot of useful information you can get from the OPs of course on other information

00:36.030 --> 00:39.400
that's when you're in stand ups in your environment.

00:39.530 --> 00:43.280
You will get a new tape on it of.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.590
It's actually a house and a virtual machine.

00:45.590 --> 00:52.350
So for example if we click on it I host number one and we check into Samadi you will find a new save

00:52.430 --> 00:56.280
about do ops for example had hard work integration.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.640
You will find an new one right there.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.380
That's Khaled's do the wraps.

01:01.460 --> 01:08.450
It show the design about develops a quick overview about the state of these holes by video ops like

01:08.450 --> 01:11.060
you see right hand updates manager compliant.

01:11.120 --> 01:11.700
That's me.

01:11.870 --> 01:15.270
This one man complains We do update it.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.730
If you remember when we do the updates section we create our profile.

01:20.930 --> 01:27.620
Then we check the profile we do this is because I host so it shows here that do not update we do profile

01:27.930 --> 01:29.960
available from the updates manager.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.380
So the simul will get our very opposite him.

01:32.540 --> 01:35.330
Of course you can't customize this one like that.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.920
You can't put the widget in any place you want to use.

01:38.930 --> 01:43.630
But as I heard you see the detail about the full story it was easier mode.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.610
Unfortunately we didn't cover the mode.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.000
But let's get a quick overview about it.
