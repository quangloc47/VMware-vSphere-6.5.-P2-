00:02.650 --> 00:10.720
So after deploying your verbs in your environment one of the requirements of using de Vere ups in the

00:10.720 --> 00:20.160
real environment is to leave the ropes working in that environment at least 13 days more times develop

00:20.200 --> 00:22.650
work more useful that I will get.

00:22.840 --> 00:29.560
Of course if you just On-Star developed today and the next day try to check the statute Virata all the

00:29.560 --> 00:30.640
data that you will get.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.630
It's not very accurate it Durrett environment.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.340
It's just our preview information that you get much.

00:39.420 --> 00:46.840
The most important of course you don't need to take any action from those that are out to begin because

00:47.000 --> 00:50.710
it is just temporary not a very important data.

00:50.850 --> 00:56.940
So for that it is always recommended to leave the Viret walk in your environment at least 13 day or

00:57.180 --> 00:59.470
two more will be more good.

00:59.970 --> 01:08.760
So when you leave your stops working for at least 13 days or 15 or 16 days after That's when your visit

01:08.950 --> 01:13.390
overtops you will get useful data about your environment.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.270
The action that necessity.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.400
And so on and so on.

01:17.400 --> 01:24.330
So for that in our home lab we can't do it because our home lab is just for the record.

01:24.510 --> 01:30.990
Also the difference between machine and the horse not used by anyone it just you do what it them.

01:30.990 --> 01:39.080
So the statue or the rocks will not be very important for me or for the purpose.

01:39.210 --> 01:44.360
So for that I get to just some examples from the Internet.

01:45.030 --> 01:55.260
So when you leave your apps after 13 or 14 days then you check do their ops that you will get a page

01:55.260 --> 01:55.980
like this one.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.410
Of course this one is not division of the.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.030
Don't you want have some change.

02:00.050 --> 02:08.030
That is what but just to get the idea he gave you the health of your environment like this one right

02:08.030 --> 02:08.480
here.

02:08.730 --> 02:14.540
If you get all the squar at greened that's me your environment is very good.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.190
It's a healthy environment.

02:16.380 --> 02:23.310
If you get some yellow color that's mean you have some warning or some issues are a small issue in your

02:23.310 --> 02:23.980
environment.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.950
Then when you get the Red Square it's a critical odor in your environment.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.500
You need to take action.

02:30.660 --> 02:38.370
Then when you put the mouse in any of the square it show you are about the issues or the objects in

02:38.370 --> 02:46.080
your environment that have a problem or it is working in a good state then you simply click on any of

02:46.080 --> 02:49.210
those Red Square to get the details about the issue.

02:49.230 --> 02:56.610
The critical issue or the warning or the immediate etc. then you get some requirement to fix that problem.

02:56.610 --> 03:01.410
For example if we check this one you right there environment health alert.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.930
Then we have health alert for dissent.

03:03.930 --> 03:10.380
Then log on to your client or visit web client and manually reconnected the hosted Center after the

03:10.380 --> 03:13.140
connection to the host is restored by voice the server.

03:13.290 --> 03:18.180
The other two were to be cancelled but many did take it that a host is not connected to the center so

03:18.230 --> 03:21.420
it's give you are critical alert.

03:22.020 --> 03:26.860
Then we have some other writers storage performance 5.5.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.450
Environment zero recommendation not accommodation available.

03:30.780 --> 03:37.040
Then we have a problem with V Center component environment recommendation to resolve the problem depend

03:37.050 --> 03:41.290
on the specific projects that cause default view etc..

03:41.490 --> 03:47.280
Then of course you have some on battlement risk then Environment efficiency it'll give you all some

03:48.270 --> 03:50.190
requirements are going right.

03:50.430 --> 03:58.260
Virtual Machine has Konik high speed work load loading superstrings 5 objects impacts one recommendation

03:58.380 --> 04:05.910
add more capacity for this virtual machine then hide spew Mustapa D2 snapshots.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.840
When you have a problem.

04:06.870 --> 04:13.970
Our delivery does not stop to reduce the height stop C S DP value and increase virtual machine performance

04:14.250 --> 04:14.890
console it is.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.160
It is not dropped into demen vitriol.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.510
My disk used a client to perform this operation and so on and so on.

04:21.510 --> 04:28.490
Let me give you a problem that some virtual machines have are a high number order snapshot so it caused

04:28.500 --> 04:30.770
the slow loading of the virtual machine.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.750
So the requirement is to consolidate any old snapshots.

04:34.760 --> 04:40.680
For example you have a better machine that have frequently not shot every one week or every two days

04:41.130 --> 04:44.580
and the number of the snapshots in your machine is height.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.230
So why do that.

04:46.290 --> 04:54.960
Please check this virtual machine and try to consolidate any snapshot of weed consuming space and slow

04:55.410 --> 04:57.050
loading of the virtual machine.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.490
So there are a lot lot of other examples.

04:59.490 --> 05:05.160
Virtual Machine has logic snapshot just what for example if the virtual machine has much of its natural

05:05.160 --> 05:07.090
delays to all that not a lot.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.510
Then another to sit down.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.790
There are some other issues.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.800
For example let's check this other image right here.

05:15.180 --> 05:20.010
This is another view from a modern version of drops.

05:20.370 --> 05:23.820
So you see the lost connectivity to the viewport.

05:23.850 --> 05:30.930
The distributed port the host has lost the redundant connectivity to the port lets me disconnect from

05:30.930 --> 05:34.110
one network adapter and have another one that still use it.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.510
So it need do redundant.

05:36.510 --> 05:40.050
Virtual Machine does continue his memory is causing stress.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.270
I mean it's overload overloaded Adami.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.760
The more memory fault is with your machine and of course drag the process of the drops.

05:46.770 --> 05:52.780
You can configure developers to do it automatically so it detects a virtual machine have a high loading

05:52.800 --> 05:57.420
of the memory you automatically try to add memory to this virtual machine.

05:57.420 --> 06:02.640
Of course you need to have more free memory in your environment to do that and so on and so on.

06:02.640 --> 06:09.360
Of course there are a lot lot of data useful data from the ropes for example an information about the

06:09.360 --> 06:15.460
shared information about virtual machine about the hauz about the network.

06:15.690 --> 06:16.750
About the.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.840
About the height of ability.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.350
Look a lot of information that you can get from drops.

06:23.370 --> 06:26.000
So you see this fire hose of review.

06:26.090 --> 06:33.030
This fear V.M. memory this fear VAMC Piru that when you take one of them and you get to say about virtual

06:33.030 --> 06:38.270
machine C.P. disk and network and so on and so on.

06:38.490 --> 06:46.980
So there are a lot of examples you can check in from Google or you can install drops in your environment

06:47.070 --> 06:48.600
and start using it.

06:48.600 --> 06:56.000
Also we have the virtual sign etc. Ald. information about the virtual sun and so on and so on.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.680
So this is a quick overview about it.

06:58.710 --> 07:08.030
Of course you need to give it a lot of time to get more data unfortunately the course is not about overtops

07:08.070 --> 07:10.130
it will need a fart in your calls.

07:11.010 --> 07:15.330
I will try to planning to carry it another course about props.

07:15.570 --> 07:18.190
But for now this is the end of the school.

07:18.480 --> 07:23.790
And if you want to know more about drops by your seat of course at the and of course you will be able

07:23.790 --> 07:30.750
to do the jobs without any problem you already have to sit and knowledge about how VM will work.

07:30.760 --> 07:38.170
You know any bank for example if you see about Demi Moore you didn't know how to do a memory of your

07:38.220 --> 07:38.820
machine.

07:38.880 --> 07:45.450
If you get a message about redundancy you know that it's information about the physical network adapter

07:45.510 --> 07:46.850
and the connectivity.

07:46.980 --> 07:47.760
We don't talk.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.530
So you are ready to use develops without needing any video.

07:52.540 --> 07:59.530
Tony Nichol's but in case you want to know more about it you can simply use the Web site of the web.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.090
What is up.

08:00.090 --> 08:07.810
Go right here you see some details about it how to get installed how its configuration how is it that

08:07.960 --> 08:08.990
store etc..

08:09.000 --> 08:19.450
There are some Isbel video right hand to get information about how to use the OPs a chicken in a small

08:19.450 --> 08:20.430
VDU right here

08:27.800 --> 08:35.060
to give you a demonstration with the dashboard so you click on this one.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.320
That's it.

08:36.750 --> 08:43.350
So next we see a quick overview about this video content in an online lock.

08:43.420 --> 08:44.410
So soon the next big.
