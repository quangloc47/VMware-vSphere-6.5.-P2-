WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:06.530
So for that we have an auction it's a resource share in a physical host.

00:06.540 --> 00:14.900
We share the resource available for the different vitrine machine how it was that we can create some

00:14.900 --> 00:20.780
resource pool that will let us to share the physical resource available in a house.

00:20.780 --> 00:23.880
So in this picture I tell you this is physical.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.160
I said what we have or even the different server that we have.

00:28.160 --> 00:33.420
By the way we couldn't use the resource poor if we don't have a cluster.

00:33.470 --> 00:37.680
The resource pool is available only in the cluster.

00:38.120 --> 00:44.660
So when we talk about the cluster that mean this cluster have three four five physical servers.

00:44.810 --> 00:51.830
So the resources that we talk about it is the Popal resource available in that cluster the total of

00:51.830 --> 00:53.850
the physical resource.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.440
So for example we have our cluster the top 100 gigabyte of frame.

00:59.510 --> 01:06.400
So the roots are a resource pool that we have in this situation is one hundred gigabyte of.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.830
So when we created our original storm like this one we have resource pool.

01:10.910 --> 01:19.040
We pick up parts of that available resource in a cluster or in that resource that were going to create

01:19.040 --> 01:22.050
for example to create a resource with top physical.

01:22.050 --> 01:27.870
So thats when we talk about the total of those two physical cost.

01:28.080 --> 01:32.530
So for example in this situation we have 100 gigabyte offerings.

01:32.700 --> 01:38.550
When we create our resource for number one and give it up part of that resource pool thats me we give

01:38.550 --> 01:43.640
it up also in terms of the resource pool for example in this situation we have about 14 percent.

01:43.750 --> 01:54.240
But this one will get 40 gigabytes or frame and also a 40 percent off C.P. that we have in this resource

01:54.240 --> 02:01.260
pool then we create our secondary source one like this one and he was about 20 percent of the resource

02:01.260 --> 02:07.340
pool thats mean about 20 gigabyte Overeem then 20 percent of the CPI.

02:07.510 --> 02:14.710
And then the available resource we can create virtual machine tools do the rest of the resource thats

02:14.800 --> 02:18.990
me and the other 40 gigabytes and 40 percent of the speed.

02:19.050 --> 02:25.350
So we have a router resource pool that this one we can't manage it or can't change it because this is

02:25.350 --> 02:26.910
the available physical resource.

02:26.910 --> 02:35.100
Of course if we want upgraded you need to buy a hardware by upgrading to spew and dream but we can't

02:35.130 --> 02:35.570
do it.

02:35.620 --> 02:41.770
Asadullah of the software but hit into software we can't control the resource pool.

02:41.970 --> 02:48.090
But of course in a limitation of the available physical resource we can't give this one more than one

02:48.210 --> 02:56.550
hundred gigabytes because we have only one hundred gigabytes of RAM so when we create a resource for

02:56.550 --> 03:00.800
number one or source or not but of course we give it any name that we want.

03:00.810 --> 03:06.510
Then of course we can create a resource pool number three to put this virtual machine or we can simply

03:06.570 --> 03:12.560
leave the other machines the rest of the resource pool then inside the resource pool for example this.

03:12.630 --> 03:19.530
Number two we can create two virtual machine this virtual machine will use DO available a little sport

03:19.560 --> 03:27.850
into number two and have a limitation of that resource for example this one have 20 bytes of rain.

03:27.850 --> 03:34.810
So this virtual machine the two of which your machine can consume only 20 gigabytes of frame for example

03:34.850 --> 03:41.320
the situation we give this one about 16 gigabytes of Vermont and this one about 16 byte over them when

03:41.590 --> 03:45.040
they start consuming the fall of the.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.370
Available right here.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.330
He can't consume more than 20 gigabytes of RAM.

03:50.380 --> 03:56.020
If you remember in the previous slide I tell you that sometimes we create our virtual machine with 4G

03:56.130 --> 03:58.780
bytes but it's consume only two gigabytes.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.010
When this virtual machine start consume four gigabytes.

04:02.080 --> 04:08.500
But it's cost you do rent of another virtual machine the other which your machine can't find any free

04:08.860 --> 04:10.230
reign to use it.

04:10.570 --> 04:17.590
But in this situation with this virtual machine to work together if this one start consume more it's

04:17.830 --> 04:25.810
consume it only for this virtual machine and this one can't touch any room of any other virtual machine

04:25.840 --> 04:27.170
outside of disport.

04:27.310 --> 04:33.330
It is limited by the 20 gigabytes of energy in this resource pool right here.

04:34.490 --> 04:40.600
Them when we create a resource for number one we give up a virtual machine four and five.

04:40.770 --> 04:45.800
And also we can create another resource pool inside our resource pool.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.870
That's not a child of arrestors board.

04:48.890 --> 04:50.810
So we create the resource pool number three.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.570
For example give is 15 percent of this race was born.

04:53.570 --> 05:00.560
That's I mean this one that gets 40 gigabytes of run these races or we get 20 gigabytes of room and

05:00.560 --> 05:04.420
this virtual machine will use the rest of this one.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.310
That's mean 20 gigabytes for.

05:07.820 --> 05:14.440
So the benefit of this work is that we limit do resource all consumed by virtual machine.

05:14.480 --> 05:21.040
That's I mean this virtual machine limited by 20 gigabyte of RAM no matter how much Jacobites offer

05:21.080 --> 05:22.910
and give it to this virtual machine.

05:22.910 --> 05:27.690
It will be limited by 20 gigabyte of ram of the resource pool.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.550
Number two and so on and so on.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.340
So this is the idea of the resource share.

05:33.530 --> 05:37.130
So then will go into Discovery resource share how it's.
