00:01.430 --> 00:02.220
Help again.

00:02.430 --> 00:05.560
So let's create our first resource pool.

00:05.700 --> 00:10.460
So a click on your resource pool give it a name

00:13.380 --> 00:15.230
and a source for aid.

00:15.440 --> 00:21.190
We'll give it to stand out in one format and this one as we click OK.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.050
So it's great art resource.

00:23.060 --> 00:24.070
All right.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.450
So if we click on it we get a quick idea about it.

00:27.620 --> 00:34.060
So you see the details of this one have five gigahertz then one gigabyte of the room.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.750
How much virtual machine and templates are available in this one part of on virtual machine.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.310
Child issues if you remember we can carry a child that is school and child.

00:43.320 --> 00:49.840
The app can get different hair than normal how much sleep use expand from zero.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.920
And limits in tool limits we have worst case on location.

00:54.920 --> 01:02.640
That's means the minimum gaze on location is zero the memory as the same etc..

01:02.900 --> 01:09.160
Some define right here then the cluster use it is the cluster that we have right there etc..

01:09.200 --> 01:16.100
So we have monitored to get to the event or the issue that we have the config the same if you want to

01:16.100 --> 01:23.990
continue to spew or memory you change it from this one for example we want to give it about high or

01:23.990 --> 01:25.440
low et cetera.

01:25.700 --> 01:29.870
Then the rain for example we want to give it more rain like that.

01:29.870 --> 01:32.800
We chose for example from Manimal to hide.

01:32.930 --> 01:33.660
OK.

01:33.850 --> 01:39.650
Then the permission the permission of the user if you remember to use a section from the previous course

01:40.310 --> 01:46.050
then the resource pool and the virtual machine available in this resource pool.

01:46.130 --> 01:48.530
Of course it's still empty.

01:48.530 --> 01:54.450
So let's create another resource pool like this one resource pool.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.010
No it's not.

01:57.010 --> 02:06.160
It's funny because simply a source for the and give is for example Now this one now.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.440
OK.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.260
Then this one if we try it it's restores for example give it high.

02:17.390 --> 02:18.040
And this one.

02:18.210 --> 02:19.060
Hi.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.290
OK.

02:20.490 --> 02:25.140
So then let's try to put some virtual machine inside a different resource board.

02:25.350 --> 02:31.440
For example does Windows 7 inside a resource or a make art

02:34.490 --> 02:37.460
they do Windows XP in the resource pool.

02:37.530 --> 02:40.430
And but talk just like this one.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.970
So when we take the Swan We have treat virtual machine inside the rest of the sport.

02:45.270 --> 02:50.940
And when you're through the machine inside the resource pool will be then of course we have some other

02:50.940 --> 02:54.470
virtual machine that's used to mount a resource or route.

02:54.490 --> 02:58.110
So does that mean the physical resources that actually.

02:58.170 --> 03:01.290
So if we take this one it's still consume zero.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.480
What is the result.

03:02.530 --> 03:09.460
Of course we need to power one on your machine to start seeing consumation of the results.

03:09.740 --> 03:13.120
So like Juan Sloan

03:15.880 --> 03:17.490
this one like that.

03:17.740 --> 03:24.320
So if we take note the resource board will see that stop consuming the available resource.

03:25.580 --> 03:34.730
And then when any virtual machine start how overloaded in our resource available in the cluster cluster

03:34.730 --> 03:41.420
we'll start distributing the resource of this host in relation about the value that we give it to reduce

03:41.610 --> 03:42.340
the sport.

03:42.440 --> 03:48.470
For example this one gets sort of virtual machine can consume height value of the resource available

03:48.500 --> 03:49.860
in the different terms.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.550
Then the same for the second one will consume up to the level of table in this one.

03:55.700 --> 04:03.930
So you see I had the memory star consume about 100 megabytes and if we checked the other one store consumed

04:03.950 --> 04:11.060
less because this one is just Windows XP does one have three bedroom machine so every one take its own

04:11.960 --> 04:12.670
resource.

04:12.890 --> 04:15.500
So this is the idea of the resource pool.

04:15.590 --> 04:18.700
We limited this virtual machine to the resource pool.

04:18.710 --> 04:24.580
I've lived in this one and this machine also limited the Baidu resource in this one.

04:24.710 --> 04:30.950
And of course any time you want to get more resource to our virtual machine inside our tools pull you

04:30.950 --> 04:39.200
back right where you change from normal to height and give it some reservation and so on and so on.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.760
So this is the idea of this one of course we can create a resource pool inside this one.

04:43.790 --> 04:51.260
So we click on it was Paul the only creates a child resource pool for example like this one resource

04:51.260 --> 05:01.250
pool a tool like this one inside and we have another resource pool then we give it value more money.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.300
So if we click on this one you see that it gets a part of this one.

05:06.310 --> 05:11.080
So the calculation it will be part from this one.

05:11.090 --> 05:13.190
So next we'll see do we up.
