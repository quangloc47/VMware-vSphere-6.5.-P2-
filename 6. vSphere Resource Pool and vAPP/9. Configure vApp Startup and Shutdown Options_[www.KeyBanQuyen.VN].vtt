WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:09.050
So do think of the up of course if you remember sipping resouce as the same as the resource poor memory.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.530
Wasn't the same then we can recognize it the F-16.

00:14.680 --> 00:22.980
This is about a difference of if don't place the location if you want to change the upbeat option for

00:23.030 --> 00:24.590
those virtual machine.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.170
We have a provision for and we use static etc..

00:29.530 --> 00:36.370
So this information about the gist of the app then we have two or three in the startup order and this

00:36.370 --> 00:38.830
is the option that we need in this situation.

00:38.830 --> 00:43.130
You see no do Windows XP on a six star power add on automatically.

00:43.480 --> 00:50.230
So the question is why start boarded on to victory in Washington by five they do virtual machine number

00:50.290 --> 00:51.080
six.

00:51.100 --> 00:55.520
So the task is already configured in this option right now.

00:55.720 --> 01:02.780
Start order if we Chiqui have the Group 1 then the group to then we can create as much as we want.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.090
It's information about how much a video machine we have in this app.

01:07.450 --> 01:12.440
So the group 1 we have the virtual machine Windows XP.

01:12.460 --> 01:18.210
Number five of course we can change it to be in the group 2 or into Group 3 it's it's not like that

01:20.090 --> 01:20.700
that's mean.

01:20.810 --> 01:21.920
This one will be one.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.350
This will be two.

01:23.540 --> 01:26.450
So let's just keep it like that.

01:26.810 --> 01:30.770
So when we click on this one we have some option right there.

01:31.010 --> 01:32.410
So let's check them out.

01:32.420 --> 01:39.920
So the startup action that's mean when we chose this startup spot on the right hand what would happen

01:40.160 --> 01:47.360
is powered on or not if we chose not that's mean we we not have the option to power on this V-Amp.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.510
So if we chose ball on that's mean the action that it will need to take is Balon.

01:52.670 --> 02:02.900
So the startup sequence proceed when about 2 minutes or 120 seconds have elapsed or two are really.

02:03.230 --> 02:03.940
That's me.

02:04.070 --> 02:12.310
When we powered on this virtual machine when he took action to do next one and star powered arm.

02:12.470 --> 02:18.470
So we have the option to wait about two minutes before the stop order on the second one.

02:18.590 --> 02:19.880
That's me in this situation.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.960
This is the database and this is the shared one connected to the Tabby's.

02:24.050 --> 02:31.970
So we config the app to power on the virtual machine of the database and we're about two minutes before

02:32.270 --> 02:36.000
bolted on the second virtual machine about should it go in.

02:36.020 --> 02:42.460
So for example we know that the database need at least four minutes to work perfectly.

02:42.470 --> 02:49.540
So automatically we can't change just one true to 14 second to power on them.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.890
Of course we can chose any time that we want.

02:53.990 --> 02:57.790
But in another situation that is even more true.

02:57.980 --> 03:05.860
We just did this one and he automatically detect the how to the beat of the tool when the VM were all

03:05.870 --> 03:06.480
sent.

03:06.490 --> 03:14.180
I heard the beat to do the app that the virtual machine of the database is ready and bolted on perfectly

03:14.500 --> 03:16.140
then it will go on.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.880
But we're on the virtual machine.

03:18.920 --> 03:26.120
So in our example it just give us about 10 seconds that's mean when you power this virtual machine about

03:26.140 --> 03:26.940
the database.

03:27.020 --> 03:29.270
In our situation is Windows XP and provide.

03:29.390 --> 03:33.870
Wait 10 seconds then power on the second one and so on and so on.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.950
Then the option of the shutdown.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.890
That's mean when we chose shutdown.

03:38.030 --> 03:42.260
What it should do to our operation is part of and this is not safe.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.880
We always request to get this shut down.

03:45.990 --> 03:46.930
That's mean.

03:47.000 --> 03:47.730
Oh come on.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.340
Of shut down a safe shutdown to get your machine.

03:51.440 --> 03:59.420
So we turn to this one that's when we chose shutdown of this the shutdown do guest operating system

03:59.780 --> 04:01.310
we do shut down.

04:01.310 --> 04:03.170
Come on then of course the time.

04:03.170 --> 04:06.290
How much time we need to shut down this one we give it to you.

04:06.310 --> 04:09.910
And that's mean hey we'll shut down the second one.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.550
So the shut process is work at the opposite direction.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.470
When we chose shutdown it shut down the second group.

04:16.470 --> 04:20.310
Dean do first and so on.

04:21.140 --> 04:27.720
So we configured this one to shut down when we chose Saddam in power on when we chose.

04:27.750 --> 04:33.980
And so the simple Stigand group we give it about 10 seconds that's me in a virtual machine in a tour

04:34.040 --> 04:36.090
group should take ten seconds.

04:36.120 --> 04:43.730
Then out on the tour group and so on and so on then the power off which was just shut down and so on

04:43.790 --> 04:44.690
and so on.

04:44.870 --> 04:49.900
Of course we have some other information right there but it's not important and not use it.

04:49.900 --> 04:57.320
For example the Produkt their version our version information about to do this is way up there on location

04:57.350 --> 05:01.430
if you want to reserve some if be for this virtual machine.

05:01.430 --> 05:08.390
For example you chose the DST speech automatically lose them or you chose it stakes for it.

05:08.390 --> 05:13.730
Does that mean that your machine will run all the way vision sex et cetera.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.710
So this is some configuration you can do it.

05:16.730 --> 05:21.560
I believe it is a virtual machine without needing to configure the displays.

05:21.860 --> 05:26.990
So let's give an example about the power of power on this virtual machine.

05:26.990 --> 05:31.350
So we give one the windows XP bolted on first day.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.220
This one.

05:32.220 --> 05:37.980
Secondly it will take 10 seconds between our own official of those virtual machine.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.460
So we click OK then we try to open this one Windows XP.

05:43.460 --> 05:47.140
Number two of course this one does not have the

05:49.940 --> 05:50.920
VM went to.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.900
So we have our own issues.

05:52.910 --> 05:57.650
So this one is bolted on number five and this one number six voted on.

05:57.650 --> 06:06.960
So if we click on the op no we have the option of power of the app and it's the M. de sooths palm.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.430
The up this mean we've put it into stand by our living room machine into standby then begin to shut

06:13.430 --> 06:14.040
down.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.400
So this is bounded off.

06:15.590 --> 06:18.510
And this is shut down sequence.

06:18.530 --> 06:19.880
So let's click on.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.150
OK.

06:21.170 --> 06:29.560
No you will see that the virtual machine number six will be power of so you see right here cannot complete

06:29.590 --> 06:36.360
operation because it is not hard the VM where all got shut down to get a pension system and its site

06:36.390 --> 06:43.820
in Morocco because this virtual machine does not have to be in where all the power of this one.

06:43.990 --> 06:48.550
So let's just do it manually and you will see

06:52.210 --> 06:52.960
it all.

06:53.310 --> 06:53.920
Yes.

06:55.640 --> 07:05.910
Of course I mean we have another process you can't complete to the other one.

07:06.100 --> 07:12.950
So let's fix this one and get this video machine from for just one right.

07:13.450 --> 07:25.010
And then we delete this one from the Wii up then we try to fix this up again of course in this situation.

07:25.030 --> 07:32.760
We're going to see that the windows new windows take a not so to become five and four.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.350
So we can change it like adults.

07:35.420 --> 07:43.450
This one right there would give it ten seconds for this one.

07:43.580 --> 07:47.450
Then we chose I guess shut down.

07:47.460 --> 07:53.990
Give it to and of course for the virtual machine that does not have the will to do we can chose the

07:54.050 --> 07:58.860
power off in this one that does not have the intellectual parts.

07:58.860 --> 08:01.720
Indescretion let's just keep it like that.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.020
OK.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.870
So no we check this one.

08:05.870 --> 08:12.980
That is of an operating system.

08:13.070 --> 08:14.400
So this one is one.

08:14.640 --> 08:23.430
And this one is bolted on the walk to the up and start the shutdown sequence.

08:23.530 --> 08:24.500
OK.

08:24.860 --> 08:27.350
So it's not bolted on the virtual machine number five.

08:27.380 --> 08:32.030
So if we're back right here you see the power off of the virtual machine.

08:32.030 --> 08:33.020
This will still work.

08:33.050 --> 08:35.020
This one start the process.

08:35.090 --> 08:44.210
So after 10 seconds he will start part of the second one operation time it's out because we give it

08:44.240 --> 08:53.130
all the turn seven eight time out you need to check that this one is powered off before audit of the

08:53.490 --> 08:54.380
second one.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.110
So this one is powered off.

08:56.460 --> 09:04.850
Then of course this one will take a little time so let's fix the problem Godard's.

09:04.890 --> 09:14.160
So in this situation to get our real example let's chose sort of to make it as quick as possible.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.920
Then why this one of course is part of it.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.090
There's not any time it's automatically stop.

09:20.250 --> 09:33.780
They actually say OK no this virtual machine is part of for example let's try to on this one again like

09:33.840 --> 09:34.260
that

09:40.580 --> 09:45.630
so let's talk about it on of costs with Eucalyptol time.

09:48.960 --> 09:57.510
If we have to divvy up this one we've reported on this wants to work perfectly if we chose this begin

09:57.510 --> 09:59.250
to shut down that's mean.

09:59.260 --> 10:04.560
Where is the power of option no folded up at your machine number five.

10:04.590 --> 10:05.070
That is it.

10:05.070 --> 10:11.970
It's bolted off then it all fits your machine before he does it it is power it off.

10:12.030 --> 10:18.750
So the virtual machine is powered off particularly Then when we chose for on own power on this one and

10:18.750 --> 10:22.550
wait 10 seconds then put it on the waterline so it's far away.

10:22.650 --> 10:32.270
The Mystery Machine and before gay if we chose this one like that to connect to do Windows XP and before

10:32.930 --> 10:36.690
then it was thought about it on the virtual machine number five.

10:36.790 --> 10:46.570
And it is it's a process thought particularly so Windows XP number four and Windows XP number five.

10:46.980 --> 10:53.880
So this is the idea of using the app to give you the ability to make some specific power on and power

10:53.940 --> 10:59.140
of management for the different virtual machine.

10:59.140 --> 11:04.300
So next we'll discover a moderate future of the team where we spend the next.
