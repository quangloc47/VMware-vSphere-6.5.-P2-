00:02.090 --> 00:03.120
Help again.

00:03.140 --> 00:06.490
So how do researchers share work.

00:06.530 --> 00:14.150
Of course when you know that to give a portion of the research the producers share is not what we do

00:14.310 --> 00:15.630
percentage a young.

00:15.720 --> 00:23.150
Just use the percentile to understand what does mean a resource pool and how we separated the resources

00:23.150 --> 00:23.790
available.

00:23.960 --> 00:31.010
But in a rich environment we use research shared by our number.

00:31.480 --> 00:40.380
So the research center is like upwind for example we have a host that hosts have about for example in

00:40.380 --> 00:45.670
this situation eight thousand plus 4000 plus two thousand.

00:45.870 --> 00:46.560
That's me.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.270
It's about 14 thousands.

00:49.590 --> 00:56.420
So when we take our resource pool that we have available in the physical host that's when we separated

00:56.430 --> 01:04.500
that resource pool to fourteen thousand point or fourteen thousand shares.

01:04.520 --> 01:11.310
It's a method to use available resource by share point.

01:11.310 --> 01:23.880
So when we create our business pool we give it our value or determinate it by the amount of sheer obstinate

01:23.970 --> 01:24.340
to do.

01:24.350 --> 01:33.210
Paul divided by the number of victory in mushing into full so we have three option choose to do resource

01:33.450 --> 01:37.620
for physical resources for different resource pool.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.130
We have the low the normal and height.

01:41.220 --> 01:50.500
So when we chose low resource pool we get about 2000 or 2000 share.

01:50.520 --> 01:59.580
So as you see here for example low 2000 cheer they when we create a normal it's give it about four thousand

01:59.680 --> 02:00.920
share.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.330
Then the high is about eight thousand shit.

02:04.470 --> 02:12.180
But I mean the resource pool of normal is bubble of do low resource pool of heights is double of the

02:12.300 --> 02:13.320
normal.

02:13.320 --> 02:20.490
So when we separate our resource pool we chose normal to give it double of the low and high to give

02:20.530 --> 02:22.630
to the dubber resource of the normal.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.880
And so on and so on.

02:24.930 --> 02:26.010
So far so good.

02:26.010 --> 02:31.120
V.M. share value are in nice 4 to 1 right across the board.

02:31.170 --> 02:36.330
So that's mean when we create additional support and of our virtual machine inside that church was for

02:36.330 --> 02:40.790
example the last one we separated to do number how we called koodoo resource.

02:40.790 --> 02:41.410
I've seen it before.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.550
That's it machine.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.560
We see the number of shared by the number of virtual machine.

02:46.560 --> 02:53.830
So this virtual machine will take about 2000 share then we choose another visual machine into normal

02:54.080 --> 02:58.560
this virtual machine take about four thousands share.

02:58.730 --> 03:03.880
Mean this virtual machine have the double rissoles of this machine.

03:04.060 --> 03:13.300
I mean if this one take about 20 percent of the super to this one take about 40 percent of the CPI and

03:13.370 --> 03:15.470
a simple dream.

03:15.470 --> 03:21.000
Then when we create a virtual machine into height should it take about 800 chip.

03:21.020 --> 03:21.620
That's me.

03:21.620 --> 03:26.910
This one will take the double missile's of this one and so on and so on.

03:27.110 --> 03:30.980
But the question is what's the situation.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.940
If we create a virtual machine in a normal or in a low.

03:35.180 --> 03:42.290
So for that we have another diagram like this one as D.M. gets added to the normal pool and unbuttons

03:42.310 --> 03:43.990
start to our career.

03:44.030 --> 03:44.500
That's mean.

03:44.510 --> 03:51.840
If we create a virtual machine in allow resouce that's mean but true in Washington about 2000 shares.

03:51.970 --> 03:56.120
Then we create for victory and machine inside the normal shit.

03:56.270 --> 04:02.820
And if you remember we surprised and put that shit up the number that a virtual machine lets me Vitry

04:02.870 --> 04:07.740
and machine will take about one thousand share.

04:07.810 --> 04:13.720
So this virtual machine took 1000 this one 1000 at this one and this one.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.530
So the virtual machine in the low shed gets about 2000.

04:18.570 --> 04:22.120
Shit that's mean it's cost room to double resource.

04:22.140 --> 04:28.870
That virtual machine exists in the normal shit because we have four virtual machine separates the powerful

04:29.150 --> 04:31.500
or the restorers exist in the normal.

04:31.570 --> 04:35.550
So it's consume only one thousand share.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.200
Then of course the highs also have one virtual machine.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.350
If we give it to virtual machine everyone will take about 4000.

04:43.470 --> 04:44.120
Shit.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.120
So it still is more powerful.

04:47.240 --> 04:52.340
But of course more virtual machines that mean less resource for a virtual machine.

04:52.670 --> 04:58.030
So another situation that we have right there to fix the imbalance.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.990
Shared values should be adjusted.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.650
Rs not GM are added to the pool.

05:02.810 --> 05:09.030
Multiply the dessert bar of virtual machines share value by the amount of virtual machine in the pool

05:09.050 --> 05:12.170
to get an appropriate pool share value.

05:12.170 --> 05:20.720
For example 4000 chip packaging and machine multiply by four yams into pool Ikhwan 16000 share for the

05:20.720 --> 05:21.420
pool.

05:21.440 --> 05:28.530
That's me to get do right shared between two different virtual machines that we want to teach in our

05:28.530 --> 05:31.150
specific share value.

05:31.150 --> 05:39.010
We need to change the sheer number for normal by Michy plain by the number of vigin machine.

05:39.010 --> 05:46.720
So for example we have four virtual machine the four thousand share need to be multiplied by four virtual

05:46.720 --> 05:51.340
machine to give Isherwood's your machine about 4000 a share.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.540
So this is the solution to fix the problem.

05:54.550 --> 06:00.070
So when we put our virtual machine into a lull we know that we give is about 2000 share.

06:00.210 --> 06:06.580
When uproots a virtual machine in a normal by adjusting the number of the share for the Marma we know

06:06.580 --> 06:10.420
that virtual machine will take about 4000 share.

06:10.510 --> 06:16.860
Then when we create a virtual machine in the hides we know that we give is about eight hundred a share.

06:16.870 --> 06:19.880
Of course in a situation we want to add another virtual machine in this.

06:19.900 --> 06:27.790
We need to change due share height and it will automatically recalculates all number by 10.

06:27.970 --> 06:34.810
So when we say that we give it's about 600 chair that does not mean the virtual machine right here will

06:34.810 --> 06:36.760
have more resources than this one.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.680
It will make its own calculation by the percentage.

06:39.850 --> 06:48.010
And of course when this one gets two gigabytes when we change this one to six thousand share this one

06:48.040 --> 06:49.860
will not have to go buy it.

06:49.870 --> 06:54.080
It will be have about 1 1 8 gigabytes.

06:54.310 --> 06:59.740
And then the virtual machine that was taking four gigabyte or this one.

06:59.770 --> 07:07.570
No it will take the move of this one but it was one point eight that's mean keep 1 6 gigabytes of RAM

07:07.600 --> 07:10.540
and not forging up to have one and do same.

07:10.540 --> 07:17.990
This one will be recalculated and take a double of this one right there or for a time of this one.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.630
That's mean about 3.6 million people by true.

07:22.690 --> 07:31.290
It's about 7 1 2 gigabyte overnight and not 8 gigabyte Ansorge so don't share.

07:31.320 --> 07:37.320
Make It's on calculation to give the separate resource between different machine.

07:37.420 --> 07:44.170
When we change share head we change all the value of the other virtual machine.

07:44.170 --> 07:49.940
It was separated by a number of variable in the different share we have.

07:50.530 --> 07:57.170
So this is the idea of the share you just know that your machine or don't normally get to the double

07:57.170 --> 07:58.830
of the virtual machine of the load.

07:59.060 --> 08:05.060
The virtual machine of the high gets Doubler's of the virtual machine or the normal You just need to

08:05.060 --> 08:10.750
put the number right and he will make its own calculation to get to do value that is double it.

08:10.790 --> 08:15.580
Of this one and this one gets to the value that he is doublet of this one.
