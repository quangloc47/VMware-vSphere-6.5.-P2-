WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:04.570
So then we have do the up to the up is a simple truth.

00:05.130 --> 00:09.630
It's like a resource pool but with some other option.

00:09.660 --> 00:15.630
So for example when we create our up we put some virtual machine inside this one.

00:15.630 --> 00:23.160
And did we control those virtual machine as a container as they worked together.

00:23.160 --> 00:28.870
For example we can create a vision machine with the firewall the CRM the and a database.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.860
For example we have a week's spurred that is connected.

00:31.860 --> 00:32.800
We did that.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.190
So it puts them inside of the app that's me.

00:35.190 --> 00:43.030
This talk between machine work together and we give it some resource pool for those virtual machine.

00:43.080 --> 00:49.110
So this virtual machine will be Vaananen sit together and work together and then when we create our

00:49.390 --> 00:57.750
Wii up we have the ability to power on power of restart et cetera for all the visual motion exist in.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.320
That's a resource pool.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.660
We're going to see it in the right environment how we can create the app how we can manage the difference

01:06.660 --> 01:08.370
between a machine inside this one.

01:08.370 --> 01:14.220
So for example in a situation that's we have our Websphere connected to that that Tabby's when we need

01:14.370 --> 01:21.690
to shut down the door that your machine automatically will need to shut down fair first then the data

01:21.710 --> 01:22.180
base.

01:22.200 --> 01:29.900
Secondly because it would be connected to the Tabby's if we power off the database Firstly it will have

01:29.900 --> 01:37.450
a corruption that are between the fair and Davies and this one can't damage our database server.

01:37.500 --> 01:45.920
So for the safe shutdown we need to shut down do that first then do that Abbes number two.

01:46.080 --> 01:53.850
Secondly so for that divvy up this option when you configure the app to give it that every time when

01:53.850 --> 02:00.680
you send a power off or a shutdown of course we need to shut down to make it safe.

02:00.900 --> 02:06.080
When we give a task to the app to shut down this app.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.750
He automatically will shutdown this one first then this one.

02:09.750 --> 02:19.120
Secondly then when we chose power on this up here will power on the database and then do this fair web.

02:19.230 --> 02:26.750
Secondly to make it work safely of course there are aeration about the firewall to CRM etc..

02:26.760 --> 02:31.830
You choose the ones that need to power on the power of and so on and so on.

02:31.830 --> 02:37.500
So let's go to do a real environment and practice the step.

02:37.610 --> 02:38.080
Next we.
