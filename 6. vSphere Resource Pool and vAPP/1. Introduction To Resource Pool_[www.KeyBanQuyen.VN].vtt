Hello and welcome in this new section that we go into discover another future of the VM where this fit.

00:07.410 --> 00:12.980
So in this section we're going to talk about do resource pool and do the job.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.790
So the first question is what is a resource pool.

00:15.870 --> 00:23.430
And so let's start we do resource pool as we know every host have some additional support our physical

00:23.430 --> 00:31.010
hosts or our server like HP Dell over Iraq have some resource pool that's me.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.800
We talk about to do resouce available in the toast.

00:34.860 --> 00:39.870
It's about the speed the memory and storage.

00:40.170 --> 00:47.430
So when we talk about the resource pool we talk about those hardware that we used to run an operating

00:47.430 --> 00:49.750
system or our virtual machine et cetera.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.360
So we have to see you.

00:51.370 --> 00:59.730
We know that every machine or every operation system or a virtual machine need to consume the C.P. need

00:59.790 --> 01:02.720
also to have some memory.

01:02.730 --> 01:08.260
Also we have a large pool of course when we talk about the storage in our resource pool of the where

01:08.550 --> 01:09.840
we do not mean to size.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.230
We talk about the input output the speed of using to store us.

01:14.490 --> 01:22.620
But of course in Arctic region derogatively where we there is much control the storage because we used

01:22.730 --> 01:29.190
external storage and external storage work alone with it eat out inputs and outputs.

01:29.870 --> 01:35.340
So in the real environment are we going to talk about C.P and don't mean more.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.880
When is V.M. Where is pare down to manage the resource pool.

01:40.010 --> 01:50.570
We managed to do more so as we know when we have a host that have a superior memory and we start creating

01:50.570 --> 01:54.480
virtual machine we can create ultimate number of virtual machine.

01:54.590 --> 02:01.230
For example a horse with the 10 gigabyte of RAM can support up to five virtual machine with two gigabytes

02:01.240 --> 02:01.930
of room.

02:02.030 --> 02:07.940
But in the real environment we can create one of those virtual machine and give it 4G got bit of RAM

02:08.090 --> 02:12.710
or maybe 6 or even we can be a bit of a brain than we have in the physical host.

02:12.710 --> 02:19.380
For example the top 10 gigabyte of Rob we can create a virtual machine with 16 gigabyte offering.

02:19.520 --> 02:28.910
So this is idea of the resource pool because we start getting some overcommitment of the resource pool

02:28.910 --> 02:31.170
available in the host.

02:31.190 --> 02:38.090
Also we have another situation for example we have five virtual machine in say the host every virtual

02:38.090 --> 02:44.700
machine have 4G garbage of RAM but it's consume only 2 gigabytes of RAM and the total available in the

02:44.720 --> 02:47.220
physical host is about changing bytes.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.200
So does virtual machine work perfectly.

02:50.360 --> 02:57.530
But in a case one of those virtual machine start consuming more than a gigabyte available to me and

02:57.560 --> 03:03.780
start consume 4G gobshites but mean it take the rain from another virtual machine.

03:03.980 --> 03:08.050
If one of those virtual machines consume 4G gobshites that's another machine.

03:08.150 --> 03:11.480
Can't find any free rein to use it.

03:11.690 --> 03:15.150
And that will give us a problem in our environment.

03:15.220 --> 03:18.860
That's mean overloading of resource.

03:18.950 --> 03:24.860
So for that we have an option that's kind of through was that Paul Willis asked to manage the resource

03:24.950 --> 03:26.140
in our host.

03:26.220 --> 03:33.590
Perfect lead to avoid overloading or virtual machine consume the resource of the other virtual machine

03:33.750 --> 03:34.570
sit down.

03:34.610 --> 03:40.270
So it will help us to manage do different resource pool we have in the physical host.
