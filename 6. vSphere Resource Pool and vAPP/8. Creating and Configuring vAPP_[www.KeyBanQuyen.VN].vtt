00:01.280 --> 00:02.080
Blogging.

00:02.220 --> 00:08.770
So let's try to create a new app so we see the resource pool which separates our virtual machine with

00:08.830 --> 00:10.210
different to boot.

00:10.260 --> 00:17.660
No we try to create a new the up and see the option that we also click neo-GOP which chose your view

00:17.660 --> 00:18.220
up.

00:18.630 --> 00:22.920
And of course we have created new app or clone an existing app.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.750
Of course this is the new one we do not have any Wii up before.

00:27.030 --> 00:34.110
So when you give it a name any name that you want for use on the app or for it is on the up seat like

00:34.140 --> 00:34.830
that.

00:34.830 --> 00:41.430
Then we chose the center that we want to put this Wii up in next.

00:41.550 --> 00:45.550
Then the same we give it some reservation normal low height.

00:45.570 --> 00:53.780
It's it is the same as the Ursula's pool next then we have information finish and we'll have on your

00:53.870 --> 00:55.010
the uprighted.

00:55.260 --> 01:01.800
So then we need to put some video inside that we absolutely have zero zero information because it does

01:01.800 --> 01:03.480
not have anything inside this.

01:03.570 --> 01:09.720
Then we put for example this Windows and this second one right there.

01:11.060 --> 01:17.180
So now we have two virtual machine inside that we operate on but this one for the base and this one

01:17.180 --> 01:21.680
for two shaded paint that's connected to the database.

01:21.740 --> 01:28.970
So of course there are still photo ops we have zero spews out on zero memory but we have some option

01:29.150 --> 01:30.250
to config no.

01:30.260 --> 01:35.260
If you check this up we have a do it on butan power on.

01:35.270 --> 01:42.410
Do this mean will power on this virtual machine exist in the app and work together.

01:42.440 --> 01:52.230
So we have that the same resource for permission virtual machine et cetera that store it out so we have

01:52.350 --> 01:54.990
some conflict to do when we want to power on.

01:55.020 --> 02:00.780
So for example this virtual machine of course we can send your own and will power on the virtual machine

02:00.870 --> 02:07.370
number five then it will power on the virtual machine and a sixth and so on and so on.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.470
So if we click all five they automatically on this one.

02:13.690 --> 02:17.700
Then let's check the second one.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.950
Of course it will take a little time apart on the second one.

02:20.990 --> 02:32.470
If we click on this machine and try to check the SO lunch console like this one we have the Windows

02:32.560 --> 02:35.050
XP port on critically.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.910
Then of course after a moment he will start forward on the second one.

02:38.980 --> 02:42.870
Let's just give it a time and that's it.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.300
So no you see it start use the memory consumed the memory and the Spirit will start costumey.

02:48.310 --> 02:53.310
But as we know I mean those XP need only some small Sibiu.

02:53.460 --> 02:59.820
So the virtual machine Wartburg actually so let's discover some option into this virtual machine ported

02:59.850 --> 03:00.240
on.

03:00.450 --> 03:04.560
So we have action or even click on this one.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.730
Of course we have bought it on part of an other option.

03:08.990 --> 03:09.560
Vitrine machine.

03:09.570 --> 03:15.300
If you want to create your machine of course we can create a new child up inside this one.

03:15.300 --> 03:20.300
They knew what it was for we can create our support inside this Wii up there.

03:20.480 --> 03:24.240
So we have the option to clone it's not available right now.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.740
Then to play it.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.230
And some other information there we have it it's sitting.
