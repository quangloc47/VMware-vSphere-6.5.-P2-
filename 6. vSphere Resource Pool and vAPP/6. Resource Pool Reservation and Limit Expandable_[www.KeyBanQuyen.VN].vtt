00:00.210 --> 00:03.780
So then we expand that option that's mean.

00:03.780 --> 00:10.760
This one can expand from zero to the maximum limit is eight.

00:11.250 --> 00:17.640
Then when we chose intermediate that's mean it's thought expanded from zero up to this number of course

00:17.640 --> 00:19.390
we have another option right there.

00:19.390 --> 00:25.540
For example the minimum it's zero when we chose 0 that's made the reservation.

00:25.560 --> 00:32.850
It will be 0 the maximum reservation is zero or we can chose more than zero because we give it limit

00:32.850 --> 00:33.970
to zero.

00:34.170 --> 00:41.610
I mean this is a pool we used zero megahertz of resource doesn't mean we can't this resource pool distress

00:41.780 --> 00:44.760
would have zero megahertz of soupy.

00:44.940 --> 00:51.840
But logically we did not chose zero didn't have the maximum available is about 8 co-horts.

00:52.110 --> 00:57.440
But of course we control any number that you want for example for Jugheads.

00:57.450 --> 01:06.620
So this one we limited this in support of four guys even we give it's a 4000 chair but we limited this

01:06.620 --> 01:09.120
one to four Zegart heads.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.440
But I mean we have some virtual machines that consume less than four gigahertz of the Sibiu.

01:15.440 --> 01:25.220
So we limited this one to four Shiga hurts then if we chose for example for an item and then try to

01:25.250 --> 01:31.320
give it any reservation we can give it more than four Jugheads of the reservation.

01:31.400 --> 01:40.760
We limited by four ziggurats we can't give it for example five Jugheads like this one you see we have

01:40.820 --> 01:42.420
our problem right there.

01:42.620 --> 01:46.670
So it is always limited by two limits right.

01:46.670 --> 01:53.610
And then of course if we give it six it will change automatically from 4 to 6.

01:53.760 --> 02:02.820
In another situation for example we give it for Jugheads of the reservation and try to change the limits

02:03.090 --> 02:04.000
for this one.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.120
Less than four gigahertz.

02:06.140 --> 02:11.280
It will give us an order we can limits this into those pools to zero.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.510
If you go ahead and the reserve are forging ahead.

02:15.510 --> 02:23.490
So if we click on this one we have all the minimum 4G Gerhard's of super mom 8 Jigar house and intermitted

02:23.490 --> 02:24.470
that's mean.

02:24.480 --> 02:30.570
We do not get in a specific number that mean it's going to start from for up to maximum from minimum

02:30.570 --> 02:31.340
to maximum.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.260
This is meaning of intermediate.

02:33.600 --> 02:40.110
But if we chose a value like that that's me we give it for Jugheads of the super.

02:40.290 --> 02:44.970
And we're limited at 5 she heads of CPI.

02:45.210 --> 02:48.620
So this is the idea between reservation and limits.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.690
It's the same as in the memory.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.840
For example we give it normal.

02:52.980 --> 03:00.610
So he automatically chose this number of the shed then hides in its anchor collection.

03:00.670 --> 03:08.260
So the number right hand it changes in relation about this one because in this situation we have the

03:08.260 --> 03:11.350
number right here is bigger than the one too stupid.

03:11.380 --> 03:17.830
So we have 18 gigabytes of the rate and only 15 gigahertz is on the CPI.

03:18.040 --> 03:24.140
So the number will be changing in the lation about this one right there.

03:24.190 --> 03:30.340
So its make its own calculation automatically You dont need to care about this number you just know

03:30.340 --> 03:37.270
that low is something low the normal is Medion do height ease height or reservation.

03:37.270 --> 03:43.130
So for example we chose Marmon the same we can give you a reservation for your machine if you chose

03:43.380 --> 03:44.400
project Gerhard's.

03:44.710 --> 03:49.060
Then we can reserve about 1 gigabytes of the range.

03:49.180 --> 03:55.410
Then we chose expandable I mean we can expand this one automatically up to the maximum.

03:55.630 --> 04:00.890
Then we have the jimmied minimum is one maximum is eight to meet it.

04:01.300 --> 04:08.910
So this one is eight is interation about the holes that have the maximum she got because of the rain.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.350
So this is the idea of the resource pool.

04:13.550 --> 04:18.010
And when we chose any resource that we have we can apply it.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.960
So next we will run the first pool scene in the next three.
