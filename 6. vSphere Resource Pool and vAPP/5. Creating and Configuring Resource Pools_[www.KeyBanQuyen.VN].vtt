00:01.110 --> 00:02.520
Hello and welcome again.

00:02.760 --> 00:06.710
So let's start creating the first sport.

00:06.740 --> 00:11.830
So of course as I look the resource pool is available only at the level of the cluster.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.820
If we try to get any resource pool from the data center we can't fund anything about the resource pool.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.440
Of course we are only of the up.

00:19.650 --> 00:25.430
But if we want to do this we need to go to the cluster and we have new resource pool.

00:25.890 --> 00:35.310
So information or a requirement for the resource pool is to have enough blood to depress if you're disabled.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.120
There is this option is not available.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.130
This one it will be disabled.

00:40.350 --> 00:46.690
You need to enable the teachers in this cluster to be able to create our resource pool.

00:46.890 --> 00:52.150
So we click and cluster we chose new resource pool.

00:52.410 --> 01:02.100
And as always we give it a name for example resource pool a like about.

01:02.190 --> 01:07.250
So we have some option in this resource pool to chose it.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.010
So let's start with this.

01:09.150 --> 01:12.010
So of course it would be like that you.

01:12.110 --> 01:15.730
To get to do so let's concentrate on the speech.

01:15.930 --> 01:23.620
So if you remember the shares we have normal that's have four thousand point or 4000 share.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.600
Then we have the low it's about two thousand shares.

01:28.740 --> 01:32.360
Then the high is about 8000 share.

01:32.370 --> 01:37.750
So where did you get this number to make it easy to chose to share.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.870
And it will make its own calculation to get to.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.450
Right.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.460
Value didn't have cost costume to make any number that you want but of course you need to understand

01:47.460 --> 01:48.680
how those numbers work.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.440
You know how about it.

01:50.520 --> 01:57.160
Example if you give it a big number that's when you consume about 80 percent or 90 percent on that resource.

01:57.210 --> 02:01.270
So if we chose for more money let's just look at the moment.

02:01.530 --> 02:07.570
Then we have another option called a reservation reservation of do c.p.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.510
So it wasn't nigger herds of course that controls gigahertz.

02:11.670 --> 02:17.110
Then of course you see the Muggsy reservation available it's five gigahertz.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.200
So what does it mean.

02:19.260 --> 02:28.170
The reservation reservation of the resource pool that's me will get our part of the pew for this resource

02:28.200 --> 02:37.080
pool and not other artist pool can use it for if we give is about four you got hurt of the Sibiu then

02:37.080 --> 02:44.820
when we try to create another resource pool Do available spew for that the resource pool is the total

02:45.060 --> 02:50.840
minus for ziggurats that's when we keep the part of the CPA only fuel.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.060
That's a resource pool.

02:52.230 --> 03:00.390
Even the virtual machine will be powered off or consume less than four Ziggo heads of the Sibiu do resource

03:00.390 --> 03:04.540
pool we'll keep this for the heads of the Super you for it.

03:04.740 --> 03:11.020
So the idea here for example we have some virtual machine that need to be run all the time.

03:11.190 --> 03:17.050
So this machine needs about 4G gobshites or we give it for you gobshites.

03:17.070 --> 03:24.100
Off to sleep you end and if we don't chose our reservation for it for example it was 0 like that.

03:24.290 --> 03:31.020
Then in a situation this virtual machine have a problem and need to reboot when we reboot this virtual

03:31.020 --> 03:32.040
machine.

03:32.040 --> 03:39.750
And when this virtual machine start bolted on maybe another machine will take do three CPR available

03:39.930 --> 03:41.880
in that cluster.

03:42.090 --> 03:45.710
And this Turing machine when we start bolted on.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.650
Can't find any available uses for that.

03:49.650 --> 03:57.280
We use reservation that's mean we keep always this for regardless of the Sibiu only for that resource

03:57.280 --> 04:01.700
pool that's have this virtual machine no matter what's happened to this virtual machine.

04:01.830 --> 04:07.810
Even this virtual machine will be powered of for some problem or even taught with how.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.970
Or maybe one day.

04:09.220 --> 04:16.680
Always before she grabs on the CPI it will be available for this video machine any time when this virtual

04:16.680 --> 04:18.480
machine will be powered on.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.500
So this is the meaning of reservation.

04:20.500 --> 04:25.720
Of course we have the muxing is about five Jugheads because we have three Isak's I host.

04:25.980 --> 04:32.240
So the total about to do CPR available in this cluster is about five gigabytes.
