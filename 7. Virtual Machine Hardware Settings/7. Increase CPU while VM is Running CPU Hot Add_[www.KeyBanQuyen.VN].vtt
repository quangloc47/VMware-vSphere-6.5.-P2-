00:01.030 --> 00:01.790
Blogging.

00:01.990 --> 00:10.400
So let's try to upgrade the resource of our virtual machine Powerade virtual machine so we click on

00:10.410 --> 00:16.230
make it it's sitting of course after enabling the heart plug in this virtual machine.

00:16.240 --> 00:17.730
When it is powered up.

00:18.040 --> 00:27.820
So I bought it of this machine and chance to see future minimize to one so I can upgrade this CPO from

00:27.820 --> 00:34.080
one to two because the opposite direction is not available in about its own virtual machine.

00:34.330 --> 00:37.740
So we have the virtual machine in Windows 7 0 1.

00:37.900 --> 00:43.060
Of course you need to have a Windows operating system that support the hot plug.

00:43.240 --> 00:49.080
Then you can charge to do CPR and the memory is uploaded on your machine.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.500
So if you go back to the virtual machine right there we have Intel Core E5.

00:54.590 --> 00:59.720
Once you return you have have Ziggo bytes of the amount of rain.

01:00.050 --> 01:07.880
And to know that when we're going to upgrade the spew out the memorial Right-Hand it will not to show

01:07.880 --> 01:12.380
up in this sitting right here until you reboot to do Windows.

01:12.740 --> 01:19.940
But for our windows server operating system it shows up directly for it was not form to Windows Server

01:19.940 --> 01:25.390
2012 or 2016 when we needed to spew and run.

01:25.490 --> 01:31.810
We see him directly into retail or from the Task Manager right.

01:32.090 --> 01:39.830
We can see them they're actually updated in about it on virtual machines but for Windows 7 or Windows

01:39.840 --> 01:48.520
then it really updates the hard work but it's not going to show up in the system into a reduced operation

01:48.620 --> 01:52.510
system but we're going to see it in another technical writer.

01:52.510 --> 01:58.270
So for example here we have the process should have only one from the device manager.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.010
We have one spew as you right here.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.200
We have the memory.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.230
What is it the memory we don't see.

02:06.250 --> 02:12.870
You know about the Memali But when we're going to upgrade the memory you will see much of it right here

02:12.890 --> 02:15.180
that we have a new memory at it.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.530
So let's try to do this one for CPI.

02:18.570 --> 02:21.180
So for example we click on do CPR on chals door.

02:21.270 --> 02:24.290
So you see we are one to two.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.600
We does not have from two to one.

02:27.630 --> 02:33.230
So for example we chose to spew we don't change any of those other option.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.520
We click OK.

02:34.800 --> 02:42.050
So the configuration of the virtual machine that is this when we get it will be finished we'll see the

02:42.140 --> 02:43.540
new update.

02:43.550 --> 02:50.700
So of course the reconfiguration of complex you back to this one you need just refresh to buck.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.540
And you know we have to c.p.

02:53.630 --> 03:00.650
So you see the CPI number one and the CPI number two of course if the physical has to have more we can

03:00.980 --> 03:03.430
add them one by one preowned option.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.010
Right.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.260
Until you satisfy the needed of your machine.

03:08.630 --> 03:15.050
So if we go back to this one and try to change it from 2 to 1 it is impossible it is impossible to go

03:15.050 --> 03:18.270
from that up value to a value.

03:18.320 --> 03:28.530
So we take in to see few if we have more CPV contrary to a 4 6 8 etc. so division machine get another

03:28.690 --> 03:30.870
spew even if he is about it.

03:30.920 --> 03:37.580
And this is one of the beautiful jewel of a dream where this fit because it is difficult to do this

03:37.580 --> 03:40.000
option in our physical survival.

03:40.230 --> 03:45.690
When you have a physical server with a protection system inside this it is very very difficult to of

03:45.720 --> 03:49.370
us spew to the motherboard that is powered on.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.060
But with our virtual machine it is very easy of course for the rain.

03:54.080 --> 04:02.930
It is possible to add more rain to the server but it is impossible almost impossible at Ostap you to

04:02.930 --> 04:05.680
do the physical server.

04:06.050 --> 04:14.820
So of course you are not going to see any updates or in the task manager because this one need to reboot

04:14.820 --> 04:15.490
to detect it.

04:15.500 --> 04:22.490
But in Windows server it will show up directly into Task Manager and in the propriety of the computer.
