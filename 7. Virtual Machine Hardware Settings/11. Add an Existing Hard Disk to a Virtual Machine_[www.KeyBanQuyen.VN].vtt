00:01.090 --> 00:01.960
Help again.

00:02.260 --> 00:08.380
So I'm not that information that you should know about the hard disk when we have a hard disk we can't

00:08.500 --> 00:10.330
delete it again.

00:10.330 --> 00:16.260
And if you remember when we Chole exist in this it does mean you can't connect an existing hartis to

00:16.270 --> 00:16.980
a virtual machine.

00:16.990 --> 00:24.670
But if that hard disk is used by another virtual machine you can't use it in this virtual machine because

00:24.670 --> 00:26.180
it is Alamoudi use it.

00:26.320 --> 00:32.370
So to give us an example about an existing disk we tried to delete this one.

00:32.410 --> 00:40.150
So if we click on the layout you see another massage device will be removing delete Fibe for all do

00:40.300 --> 00:41.200
that cost more.

00:41.320 --> 00:46.540
So if we click on this one that's means the hard disk number two will be deleted from do that.

00:46.750 --> 00:54.250
But if we leave it like this one it will stay in the past and just deleted from the virtual machine.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.280
So for example it's box it is a machine.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.380
So this is the hard disk in a bottle.

00:58.600 --> 01:06.960
We try to create a new folder like that then Anjar not bait like this one.

01:06.990 --> 01:10.820
So these are hard to find inside.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.760
So we have novel Dosey and novel Dukie all text even if we up and just want to open it.

01:19.180 --> 01:24.390
Then if we go back to the swamp and we chose castle of course you don't want to consider this option

01:24.390 --> 01:25.310
you click on this.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.940
Then we try to delete this one without deleting the 5 from do that.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.040
So it just won't exist in the run.

01:34.060 --> 01:44.160
Number one we remember this information and you check that the name is the name is 1 7 0 1 0 1 the Dougie.

01:44.170 --> 01:49.680
So this is the name of the hard disk number to exist in land 1 in Windows 7.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.860
Number one.

01:51.100 --> 01:57.700
So we click on this one without checking this one to delete the disk we click OK.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.530
So this is the latest if you back to the Vitry machine do disk is gone.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.640
This one it.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.740
You'll see right here that the disk does not exist.

02:08.870 --> 02:14.410
If you go back to the computer you'll see the disk is gone.

02:14.420 --> 02:22.490
No if we try to up on your hard disk but we up on the existing hard disk.

02:22.790 --> 02:28.850
So if we click on this one this time we're not going to chose new hard disk we're going to chose existing

02:29.120 --> 02:30.440
hard disk.

02:30.620 --> 02:35.990
So we click on we got to the last one if you remember this but your machine exists in the line what

02:36.370 --> 02:43.580
we click on made in Windows 7 0 1 because it was in the Windows 7 is 0 1.

02:43.580 --> 02:52.970
Then we have do VM decie of the windows 0 1 we have Windows 7 0 1 that's one that's mean.

02:52.970 --> 02:56.120
This is due Cygne one that we use it.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.660
Of course we can't use this one because it is our duty to use it in the same host.

03:00.710 --> 03:07.330
So we need to choose this one that was deleted before that's mean not virtual machine use this disk.

03:07.340 --> 03:08.930
So we click OK.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.650
So how does it do new disk audits.

03:11.650 --> 03:17.930
But of course no you can't change this information because it is already configured.

03:18.010 --> 03:19.200
And provision.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.990
When we create this hard disk we chose things so we can't change it.

03:23.140 --> 03:28.790
Then there's option is available to be changed of course if you want to choose the scuzzy controller.

03:29.150 --> 03:33.370
But it is always I want it to use on the Discovery controller.

03:33.650 --> 03:40.650
So we click OK the reconfiguration if we are going I tell you receipts back again and when we open the

03:40.760 --> 03:44.230
file stand available in this hard disk.

03:44.320 --> 03:49.700
Nevada and Nevada can still exist in due disk without any problem.

03:52.370 --> 03:56.960
So this is a quick idea about a hard disk and how you delete it.

03:57.290 --> 04:02.120
But in a case you chose to delete the VM dignified.

04:02.120 --> 04:07.300
It will be deleted with all the data exist inside as if you chose this one.

04:07.310 --> 04:14.960
All the data exists in that hard disk will be deleted and you lost out in this one.

04:15.260 --> 04:22.160
So you should careful when you try to delete a disk until you are sure that you don't need the data

04:22.160 --> 04:24.590
exist in that hard disk.

04:25.070 --> 04:25.760
So the next.
