00:00.450 --> 00:09.480
They will have to ask Mark do dependent independent and independent not persist is persistent and not

00:09.480 --> 00:10.260
persistent.

00:10.290 --> 00:19.440
So what do you do this more by default it creates a hard this automatically shows dependence dependence.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.290
That's mean our moment.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.590
This can be use it for our snapshots.

00:24.630 --> 00:32.010
We're going to talk about post-nuptial later but the dependent disc are included in our Snapshot.

00:32.010 --> 00:32.460
That's me.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.820
This one can be use it to create our Snapshot.

00:37.110 --> 00:45.510
But when we chose independence and the option resistant that's me challenge are immediately and permanently

00:45.540 --> 00:52.540
right into the disk persistent disk are most affected by snapshot where we chose independence.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.720
We can't create a snapshot to this virtual machine.

00:55.770 --> 01:00.480
This machine will not give you the ability to create a stopwatch for this one.

01:00.480 --> 01:09.070
And when we chose system that man will write to the disk directly without any problem.

01:09.220 --> 01:16.140
But when we disable does not in this host but all the child would be civies where we chose independence

01:16.320 --> 01:22.810
no persistent charge to disk are discarded when your power of your virtual machine or revert to the

01:23.430 --> 01:25.780
snap shot.

01:25.800 --> 01:33.080
The third option non-persistent but me you make this hard driver in Job.

01:33.090 --> 01:33.620
That's me.

01:33.620 --> 01:40.420
You push the operating system in that hard drive or your application or anything inside this machine.

01:40.650 --> 01:48.480
And when you change the disk more independent non-persistent that's mean any use that is dismiss your

01:48.480 --> 01:54.530
machine tried to install any software inside this machine deletes any filed anything.

01:54.720 --> 02:02.670
When this machine powered off and try to put it on again it spoke to preview a configuration that you

02:02.820 --> 02:06.850
left it when you chose the disk mode not persistent.

02:06.990 --> 02:13.680
It's like you use a software what's called deep freeze software was our redefined most in cyber coffee

02:13.740 --> 02:20.430
or in a public computer we used non-persistent that's mean anyone can use this machine to connected

02:20.440 --> 02:28.270
to internet to try doing some homework or for example in the library when you have a desktop or laptop

02:28.320 --> 02:32.550
use it for the public students in our library.

02:32.550 --> 02:38.400
Students can create some application can install some software can you did something in the operating

02:38.400 --> 02:39.640
system etc..

02:39.840 --> 02:48.420
But to save your machine from every time you need to get this machine and try to fix the problem you

02:48.420 --> 02:56.160
chose independent not persistent and no matter what the challenge happened for this machine it would

02:56.160 --> 03:03.330
just simply power off and on and on the child will discard and your virtual machine will back to the

03:03.570 --> 03:07.720
states that you make it in the preview time.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.090
So it's like when is the Duprees when your power of the vision machine.

03:11.270 --> 03:18.950
The data and the history dilated and the virtual machine back to do trivial state before using do not

03:19.110 --> 03:20.650
persistent.

03:20.670 --> 03:27.310
So this is the option of the persistent and non-persistent and we always chose dependence.

03:27.420 --> 03:31.680
If you want to use the snap shot the individual the mode.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.640
Scalzi.

03:32.670 --> 03:39.840
Of course we chose the kind of cable that we want this hard disk connected the motherboard the virtual

03:39.840 --> 03:48.450
motherboard on this virtual machine connected to the Virtual Hard Disk we do control or we do I do zero.

03:48.510 --> 03:53.080
I do one or SATA controller and we have some version of the star.

03:53.130 --> 04:01.960
It is information about the speed and the option for each of those subtle so mixed with Discover the

04:02.040 --> 04:04.460
other option we have in our virtual machine.
