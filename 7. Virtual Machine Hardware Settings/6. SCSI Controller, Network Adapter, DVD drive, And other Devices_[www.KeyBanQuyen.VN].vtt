WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.120
Help again.

00:02.350 --> 00:09.640
So next we have do scuzzy controller as the one that we have right there do scuzzy control has it all

00:09.640 --> 00:12.130
connected to this hard disk.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.790
We have discussed control option right there.

00:14.860 --> 00:19.000
It is not available to it into your part of the virtual machine.

00:19.090 --> 00:23.060
But of course you can add cost control from hell.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.060
For example this one.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.450
And you can mediate editing for this one.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.850
So you chose music out of it.

00:30.850 --> 00:38.240
I mean if you have physical control inside our house you can use directly to this virtual machine.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.770
Then the option of two channel tape etc..

00:41.890 --> 00:49.810
So the scuzzy controller vidual this cannot be shared between virtual machine or virtual this can be

00:49.810 --> 00:56.350
shared between a virtual machine or any other server or virtual this can be shared between virtual machine

00:56.350 --> 00:58.070
on the same server.

00:58.540 --> 01:07.570
So if we chose our a hard driver or a hard disk with something else then the ice causing this one right

01:07.570 --> 01:18.810
here if you remember we have a zero on one or scuzzy or Sotha if we chose any tank rather than the scuzzy

01:18.890 --> 01:19.610
controller.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.910
This hard disk does not have the ability to shading its store.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.990
This one like that your hard disk.

01:28.230 --> 01:28.960
OK.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.820
Then we click on the hard disk like that's

01:35.530 --> 01:44.470
then if we chose for example I do the shooting will not be available for this one or you will have some

01:45.070 --> 01:50.950
problem of the sharing of the hard disk between different virtual machine.

01:50.950 --> 01:57.980
So we always need is discussing a controller like this one of course where you're connected to do exists

01:57.980 --> 02:03.790
because the controller Brazil uses by the first one if you remember when we have a cable that's have

02:03.820 --> 02:05.170
dual port.

02:05.260 --> 02:12.820
We have the one that's connected to the motherboard and two port connected to do two to hard disk.

02:12.820 --> 02:20.050
So that means you can't use the same controller to connect two physical hard disk or three or as much

02:20.140 --> 02:23.620
as we have added to cable of the scuzzy control.

02:24.030 --> 02:30.350
But we chose not cause the controller to connect with another one.

02:30.390 --> 02:35.200
And of course a revision machine can support up to four new scuzzy control.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.790
That's mean you can create false Kozhikode.

02:37.830 --> 02:44.890
If we try to add another hard disk it will use another control the second third and default.

02:45.090 --> 02:49.570
Then you can't OD on your control with our new hard disk.

02:49.590 --> 02:58.370
You need to connect the hard disk with a sane Scalzo control available in the machine of course I mean

02:58.380 --> 03:03.740
we need to raise a hard disk we simply click on this option right and then we have the option of ice

03:03.800 --> 03:07.400
cause you can choose the one that you want.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.100
Then we have to network adapter.

03:11.280 --> 03:17.040
We talk about this one in the preview so the network you can't chose any network available for example

03:17.040 --> 03:24.530
if the whole top door VM network for example one for the villain one and another one for the two.

03:24.630 --> 03:30.390
You can chose this virtual machine from villaine want to be allowed to you can see the list of the VM

03:30.390 --> 03:32.230
network available right there.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.720
Then the option to connect me connect.

03:35.730 --> 03:43.470
It's like when you plug in plugged the cable or you enable and disable do physical network adapter we

03:43.470 --> 03:44.870
have in the host.

03:45.240 --> 03:50.180
So when you chose a disconnect like this one this virtual machine will be disconnected from the network

03:50.180 --> 03:56.430
drogue these network adapter which was connect those you're connected they have the option connects

03:56.520 --> 03:58.110
at power on.

03:58.170 --> 04:04.200
If we enable this one and click OK this rigid machine will keep connected to the network because we

04:04.200 --> 04:10.010
have this one check it then we do with power of this video machine and power on it.

04:10.010 --> 04:16.110
Again it will be disconnected because we chose to not connect at all were.

04:16.470 --> 04:22.760
So always because this one connects at our own thoughts mean no matter what happen to this virtual machine.

04:22.770 --> 04:31.470
And part of it is part of it were to connect to the network then have this option adapter tried to change

04:31.500 --> 04:34.630
the speed of the adapter the MAC address.

04:34.650 --> 04:40.740
Of course you need to power of the virtual machine to be able to change the speed and to mock Athanase

04:40.770 --> 04:44.680
of the vitriol machine of this Vitruvian network adapter.

04:44.820 --> 04:50.700
Then we have the cd dvd driver we have the option to connect to the client device.

04:51.050 --> 04:51.880
That's mean.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.890
This virtual machine connected to city the driver of the client.

04:55.890 --> 05:00.460
Davies lets me do the cd dvd driver of my laptop.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.140
This one right there.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.550
It is connected to this one.

05:06.550 --> 05:15.890
Any City DVD footage inside my laptop DVD driver will be detected by the virtual machine and we read

05:15.890 --> 05:24.190
the contents of that CD and we have the host device lets me do a physical server.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.650
Thats why this is.

05:25.670 --> 05:29.600
I host have also our DVD driver.

05:29.630 --> 05:34.720
This machine will connect to DVD drive an overdue physical host.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.590
How I do have.

05:36.650 --> 05:42.990
I host so this option is connected to DVD drive directly off the server.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.670
Of course how do you chose connect or disconnect.

05:45.670 --> 05:50.910
But you should care about this one when you choose to press and emotion.

05:51.080 --> 05:58.190
Because if the terrorists want to migrate this machine from a host a to a host be it this host connected

05:58.190 --> 06:05.780
to the host device will not going to migrate this virtual machine because we have a neuro So we always

06:06.020 --> 06:08.260
get disconnected until we need it.

06:08.300 --> 06:15.830
Then we enable this one also connects up both on me mean connected to house device.

06:16.040 --> 06:23.600
We were power on your machine then we have the Isel Phylis me and from the data it will take a nasal

06:23.600 --> 06:26.320
image from the data available light.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.020
Take for example the store.

06:28.210 --> 06:34.050
Me look at the all of the E-6 I host the top is Windows then the lot want lunch.

06:34.110 --> 06:41.380
And the image lets me do floppy or ISO image.

06:41.440 --> 06:47.780
Then we have do content liberally Isel mean from the center when we create at center we create our live

06:47.850 --> 06:49.960
to put it tank inside it.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.840
It's like a shared folder between the different E6 I host.

06:54.670 --> 07:02.890
So does the news client host then to connect power on the VM and select the media from the VM hardware

07:02.890 --> 07:09.660
panel on Shoemark up in the device mode emollient CD or past drug CD.

07:09.790 --> 07:14.080
Then of course the video device more connected through the south.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.000
Of course you need to port after chance this option right.

07:18.150 --> 07:23.470
Then we have to use Be as the same as CD you have speech upon zero.

07:23.470 --> 07:26.950
You can't change just sitting for example trip 1 0 etc..

07:27.130 --> 07:29.740
Also you can use the right hand

07:32.430 --> 07:33.830
or house to use.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.980
People like this one not available.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.410
Doesn't mean if I already have.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.270
Are you still connected to my host.

07:40.410 --> 07:48.350
I can't Adi's that of this machine to be connected directly so it shows the controller to click out.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.030
You will see a new one right here.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.930
It is at its byte 3.0.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.580
Then you control this control and is not supported for the guest operating system.

07:57.480 --> 08:04.000
So we have an issue right here because we have two options you don't so we can't add to 1 0.

08:04.410 --> 08:06.430
We need only to change trip on 0.

08:06.540 --> 08:10.960
But this operating system does not support 3 1 0.

08:11.100 --> 08:16.110
Then we have to VDU cock a specific custom seating.

08:16.170 --> 08:20.900
You can't chose the details about the video card in your host.

08:21.010 --> 08:26.000
And right had to check it out Arduin video memory 3-D graphic.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.390
You can enable to see the graphic in this video machine.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.940
Of course you need to have a video card that she poured the coffee.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.840
Also that video card shrewed support the virtualization.

08:37.840 --> 08:43.860
Put example example in videos you force can support your decision.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.720
So you connect this video card to the physical host then you attach it to this virtual machine that

08:50.880 --> 08:51.780
does nothing with.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.370
Is this a video card.

08:54.600 --> 09:00.630
Give the user that these virtual machine the ability to work with the software that need our hide video

09:00.630 --> 09:04.910
card like three digraph Rafique and some other option.

09:05.100 --> 09:12.100
Also we have the VAMC device between machine communication and verifies that's connected to virtual

09:12.150 --> 09:17.940
machine directly to the device of the motherboard of the server etc..

09:18.150 --> 09:26.330
Then do other device like do I do the cable or the psa number 2 etc..

09:26.850 --> 09:33.750
So this is a different option we have in our military machine and we are going to make some editing

09:33.780 --> 09:38.590
to see the result directly in our product on the machine.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.510
So the next to be.
