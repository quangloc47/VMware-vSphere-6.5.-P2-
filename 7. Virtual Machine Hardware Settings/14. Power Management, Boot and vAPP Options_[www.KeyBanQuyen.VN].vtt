WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:04.360
Then we have to what management do.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.200
Our management of that is your machine.

00:07.200 --> 00:14.940
How should the virtual machine respond when just operating system is lost said on standby when you chose

00:15.060 --> 00:23.100
standby to do just operating system into standby mode by live into victory or machine powered on thence

00:23.180 --> 00:24.540
respond to victory machine.

00:24.540 --> 00:25.130
That's me.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.020
This work adlibbing of the virtual machine at this work Abdulhamid of the operation system.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.410
When you chals spawn the video machine it will respond to your machine Abdula bit of the machine.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.320
But when you chose to get a pension system interest on the buy It's like when you click Start and chose

00:43.410 --> 00:49.830
standby week on land option to work on Londis mean you cut our own division machine.

00:49.840 --> 00:55.010
From a distance you can't check it just one didn't have the boot option.

00:56.570 --> 00:58.510
Define word is do a BIOS.

00:58.510 --> 01:06.770
Or I F E this some information about the motherboard then with delight whenever the virtual machine

01:06.770 --> 01:14.810
is bolted on or estates delight to boot order 4 0 miles for force will be all set up if you want to

01:14.870 --> 01:18.790
make the bill say stop it to this virtual machine.

01:18.790 --> 01:23.560
The next time the virtual machine boot forced entry into Beal's stop screen.

01:23.660 --> 01:31.550
That's me when I chose this one and tried to power on this machine to really get inside the BIOS setup.

01:31.790 --> 01:35.840
Then I need to click escape to start on and on.

01:35.960 --> 01:43.070
Then when I power of the virtual machine and power on is I get it will take me to do bios setup again.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.540
So it is not at all my own.

01:45.550 --> 01:49.500
Did you need to make some change in the BIOS.

01:49.740 --> 01:50.670
Fight fight recovery.

01:51.020 --> 01:57.720
If you want to boot from the boot recovery of these between machine of course it's not uncommon that

01:58.740 --> 01:59.900
they end encryption.

01:59.900 --> 02:08.270
If you want to encrypt this virtual machine if you remember opportunistic disable or require then the

02:08.360 --> 02:13.650
other one said If you want to get some other ones that disable acceleration acceleration optional as

02:13.700 --> 02:21.920
between machine enabled low gain range normally Ricordi will gain etc and some swap file by default

02:21.920 --> 02:23.970
division machine directory etc..

02:24.200 --> 02:27.040
So this is a different option we have.

02:27.260 --> 02:32.590
And another option that we have right here is the fiber channel.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.150
That's me.

02:33.230 --> 02:40.490
If you want to use it should be a network adapter connected directly traduce one to this machine to

02:40.490 --> 02:41.170
use.

02:41.170 --> 02:44.500
Do that extend on stars as a local storage.

02:44.510 --> 02:49.870
You need to use do fiber channel vitriol W.W..

02:49.920 --> 02:58.090
And as of course after connect the network adapter it should be to this virtual machine you can it it's

02:58.090 --> 03:03.520
I'm sitting right here to detect do fiber channel into a network.

03:03.630 --> 03:07.510
So this is a different option we have right there and then we have.

03:07.550 --> 03:16.450
Is there as the splosh DNS can it it's some information state of course you can for example at the stores.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.290
You need to read on the IPT if you remember them.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.880
Between the defendants hard disk etc..

03:22.160 --> 03:29.900
But this option we already cooperate then have the app option if you want to config some of the up as

03:29.900 --> 03:32.130
we saw in the up option right here.

03:32.420 --> 03:37.640
We have different option available Abdula it is better yet machine.

03:37.640 --> 03:43.540
So this is a different option of two hardware and you are a virtual machine.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.050
So hope that everything is clear.

03:46.070 --> 03:49.220
If you have any question please share it in the discussion.

03:49.220 --> 03:56.200
Also if you have any information it is recommended to share it with us and other students and see you

03:56.200 --> 04:01.440
in the next section with our next future of the VM when it's too soon to be.
