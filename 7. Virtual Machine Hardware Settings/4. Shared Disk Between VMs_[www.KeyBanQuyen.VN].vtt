Blogging.

00:02.790 --> 00:11.770
So to see this option about a discommode and Duchaine we need to try to add a new hard disk to get about

00:11.770 --> 00:12.240
it.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.070
That's why I like that.

00:16.340 --> 00:20.310
Then give it the option number.

00:20.630 --> 00:29.650
No we can chose to start with the virtual machine or Prowse to put it in a specific spot like this one.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.970
But of course leave it by default.

00:31.970 --> 00:36.830
Then we have to take provision and then we choose then then do shitting.

00:36.920 --> 00:41.400
If you remember the shooting and Disk Mode No it is available.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.990
Let's talk about the shooting.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.370
So the shooting is not shit.

00:45.650 --> 00:46.690
The shooting.

00:46.700 --> 00:57.240
We have no shooting or muchi writer the shooting of a hard disk meaning that one how this can be used

00:57.240 --> 01:00.150
is by different virtual machine.

01:00.470 --> 01:06.450
If we chose specific that's mean only this virtual machine we use this hard disk.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.150
Look up us.

01:09.310 --> 01:12.420
But when we chose not sharing that's mean.

01:12.430 --> 01:20.860
We did the sharing in this hard disk does mean no other machine can detect this hard disk and to write

01:20.980 --> 01:25.990
and read from this disk then we have the military writer.

01:26.220 --> 01:31.740
Of course if you are familiar with a pension system when you try to share our folder from an operating

01:31.740 --> 01:39.030
system you have the option to click on any folder and share that folder we network.

01:39.180 --> 01:45.620
But when you try to share a hard driver you do not have the option to do that because the driver do

01:45.700 --> 01:47.840
with our Asadullah that's mean.

01:47.940 --> 01:55.140
This is do not eliminate this hard disk from shitting in our network.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.730
So this is the option that we have in our virtual machine.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.790
We have not sharing or in specific that's mean related.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.080
Later on our patients tend to chose to share or not then Meucci right or multi.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.240
Right so that's me.

02:09.290 --> 02:17.210
This hard disk will be available to use by different virtual machine for example we have some applications

02:17.220 --> 02:26.250
that need to read and write from a specific hard disk and another application that use the same hard

02:26.250 --> 02:26.700
disk.

02:26.700 --> 02:36.760
For example in A Reason For example the nickel soft cluster is a Microsoft cluster or our Oracle cluster.

02:36.780 --> 02:44.430
They use different machines but they use the same locale that store the same hard disk the sharing the

02:44.430 --> 02:53.270
same hard disk and saving the data for the same hard disk even we have two or three operating system.

02:53.480 --> 02:59.030
That the Microsoft cluster connected to want a shared local hard disk.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.720
So this is the idea of the sheening if you chose not.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.460
Shane you deserved this option.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.430
M.T. right.

03:05.470 --> 03:11.120
That's mean multiple virtual machine can use this one to save the data.
