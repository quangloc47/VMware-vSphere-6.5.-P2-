00:01.240 --> 00:08.500
Hello and welcome in this new section that we're going to cover more details of our virtual machine

00:08.920 --> 00:17.590
in the preview the cost part number one that's we cover how to create and our style is excite and managed

00:17.620 --> 00:20.770
by the central server and how to create virtual machine.

00:20.770 --> 00:30.280
And it did we cover only deuse beginner option available in our virtual machine like how to create Sibiu

00:30.430 --> 00:35.040
Mazda Riem the driver do hardware.

00:35.470 --> 00:46.870
But no after covering more information like depress the resource pool and some other option we can now

00:47.060 --> 00:53.130
cover the other option we have in a virtual machine that we didn't cover in the preview course.

00:53.350 --> 00:57.890
So for that when we have a virtual machine we simply click on it.

00:58.130 --> 01:04.710
Of course you remember the option we cover some of them and we still have some other option to cover.

01:04.990 --> 01:11.270
So we click on you did sitting through it did the stitching of this virtual machine.

01:11.350 --> 01:18.670
So if you the number this interface we already talked about it about to see how to change the speed

01:18.670 --> 01:21.470
of our virtual machine the memory etc..

01:21.730 --> 01:26.770
But if you remember we do this option in up outside of a virtual machine.

01:26.770 --> 01:27.570
That's me.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.940
We take a port of entry and machine we click on it.

01:32.440 --> 01:37.960
We chose heated seating and we start in the rain etc..

01:37.960 --> 01:46.270
For example we change from one to two from two socket etc. and so on and so on we would click ok then

01:46.600 --> 01:49.180
do it it didn't happen to just one.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.760
But when we tried it is about it on your machine.

01:53.830 --> 01:58.760
This option was not available for example in this one right.

01:58.870 --> 02:06.800
We can't charge Sibiu or drame etc. we need to polish up the virtual machine but drop the VM were restrained.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.340
We have another option that's called a hot plug.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.230
As you see here we have C.P hot plug.

02:14.350 --> 02:21.140
It does not give us the ability to enable this one but for that you need to power of this machine enables

02:21.310 --> 02:22.070
this one.

02:22.120 --> 02:29.040
Then when your power on you will find that these options are challenged and the memory is available.

02:29.050 --> 02:32.220
So here's the other one memory hot plug.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.990
If we try to do this one in our power of virtual machine click like that

02:41.380 --> 02:43.140
then we got to spew.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.280
We have the option to enable this one.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.560
Of course it's not available.

02:46.570 --> 02:51.990
No because this Windows XP does not support the hot plug.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.510
Also I know that information that the hot plug is in relation avouch do operate consistent in this one.

02:58.510 --> 03:04.600
So for that's when you go to the VM option we didn't talk about this one.

03:04.610 --> 03:07.200
We have some option to configure right.

03:07.370 --> 03:11.090
That will let us to chose a different option right there.

03:11.210 --> 03:13.430
It is integration about the one that we have here.

03:13.430 --> 03:20.630
So for example when our division machine is Windows XP number six the store house.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.580
This one is that number three.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.790
The Wii remote location is in Windows XP 6 this is a virtual machine.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.750
Then we have the insist it is Windows.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.070
Then we have two windows XP.

03:34.070 --> 03:37.820
So Windows XP does not support the hot plugging.

03:38.030 --> 03:45.770
But if we chose another Windows that supported the hot plugging of course had for example Windows Server

03:45.950 --> 03:54.520
2012 and then when we go back to this one we have to enable Scipio's plugin enabling not we can't use

03:54.520 --> 04:01.560
do spew hot plugin because we choose our Windows 2000 AES from Windows 7 and more.

04:01.570 --> 04:05.700
The operating systems support hot plugging.

04:05.830 --> 04:13.030
So if we chose for example on a pension system that does not support the hot plugging like this one.

04:13.030 --> 04:14.480
So this one is disable.
