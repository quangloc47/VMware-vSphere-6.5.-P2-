00:00.930 --> 00:01.700
Blogging.

00:01.900 --> 00:08.830
So the next option we have in a virtual machine is do a hard disk.

00:08.850 --> 00:15.120
Also we cover a little about the hard disk into preview cards so no we're going to discover this new

00:15.240 --> 00:21.960
option that we have right here that we didn't call her in the preview quotes so as to say we have a

00:22.200 --> 00:24.930
number of jigaboo of the hard disk.

00:24.930 --> 00:29.520
This one take about 20 or 40 gobshites the maximum size.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.070
It is information about the size available in the host.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.360
So the hosts have about 50 years ago right.

00:35.370 --> 00:41.540
It's costing them about one on the hard Jacobites sword available is forty eight gigabytes.

00:41.700 --> 00:47.550
So we can get space to just hard disk to maximum size to eight.

00:47.690 --> 00:51.010
GIGOT When do you see it is in a bottle.

00:51.130 --> 00:57.270
Do you see the Wii ball Narok wife and vison default storage will you see this is integration about

00:57.690 --> 01:04.220
kind of the datastore use in either a house or in external storage shed its trust.

01:04.290 --> 01:12.480
How for example can ease of DIVOLA harddrive or our recent storage then do the occupation that mean

01:12.480 --> 01:18.600
you would encrypt the storage of this virtual machine then do default that are store.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.630
Well then we have the time.

01:20.780 --> 01:28.110
And of course you can't do that and take provision about it on Victorien machine or even when you create

01:28.170 --> 01:35.730
our harddrive if you want to know what does mean thin and thick BroadVision you back to preview calls.

01:35.780 --> 01:41.430
Then we have the shielding dishing is not the same as share.

01:41.430 --> 01:48.810
If you remember we talked into Preview Domani and you are about to share and no we have shinning you

01:48.810 --> 01:53.600
see ahead we have no shitting because this hard disk is use it right.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.710
No we need your power of to be able to use this option.

01:57.870 --> 02:04.650
So we discovered the shed as the same as the Scipion did we have the shed as normal high and low.

02:04.650 --> 02:16.500
So for example the low How about 5000 The high is about 2000 and about the one Townsends shit.

02:16.540 --> 02:24.880
This is addition about inputs outputs IOPS speed of read and write in how driver you give is the Pre-OT

02:24.880 --> 02:29.590
for some virtual machine then other virtual machine of the data base.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.510
You should give it's about height share that's me in this database.

02:34.570 --> 02:37.470
Need to write and read more about that.

02:37.540 --> 02:44.990
So you give it height check to give it a priority to do a virtual machine of the database.

02:45.090 --> 02:50.190
Then we have to limit input output operation.

02:50.190 --> 02:56.570
That's me IOPS as we see in CPR on him and we also heard we have some limits.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.500
Of course you can give it some specific limits for example 200 etc. but of course if you try to give

03:02.570 --> 03:13.520
his number is not supported limits like you see her limits IOPS must be between 16 and this number.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.010
The amount is too small.

03:16.030 --> 03:21.300
I mean if you give it six this machine would not want it to work because it is a lot of work.

03:21.310 --> 03:27.120
We did a speed of six operation bar savant or six IOPS Sue-Linn.

03:27.540 --> 03:34.100
That's me IOPS eats me input output but so I can read and write part signon.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.730
So you give it a six.

03:35.730 --> 03:36.880
This is illogical.

03:36.930 --> 03:44.520
So you need to be with a specific number and this one you let me do I'm put all of this how driver by

03:44.820 --> 03:46.180
six thousands.

03:46.290 --> 03:54.430
And this is something very dangerous that you should take care of all this one and always wait to a

03:54.510 --> 04:01.100
specific inputs output number right there into our application Wardo or an operating system hornbook

04:01.410 --> 04:08.590
request you to put a specific number right here because this one can damage to a harddrive that has

04:08.700 --> 04:15.870
this Vitry disk example the shaded storage or the local splosh.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.980
Then we have the virtual flash read cache do flash cache.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.210
You can specific do flash read.

04:24.220 --> 04:24.680
Gosh.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.450
So what does mean to flush with cash.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.520
That's me.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.270
We use our specific size from the harddrive to use it as our memory.

04:34.320 --> 04:42.840
Rain for example in this one I have for example in my laptop I have about 16 gigabyte of RAM but the

04:43.310 --> 04:51.810
operating system is about 1 gigabyte offering from the cache of the harddrive and so it is one before

04:52.170 --> 04:55.070
five minutes before it was number two right there.

04:55.090 --> 04:57.930
And it was 18.

04:57.930 --> 05:05.930
So when I consume about 18 gigabytes of the frame with the physical frame and the vitriol cache that

05:06.000 --> 05:12.690
uses as r.m of another one gigabyte from the harddrive and that's make to computer a little slow when

05:12.690 --> 05:19.440
we are on over loading on the frame you start started some data out from the rain into a hard drive

05:19.620 --> 05:21.080
and use it as a room.

05:21.210 --> 05:28.770
So it look its change and start becoming low automatically of course when I have some free rein in the

05:28.770 --> 05:35.240
physical memore room he start uploading that hard over to memory.

05:35.620 --> 05:42.490
So some part of the harddrive as our memory RAM in this.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.810
So this is the idea about the veggie or flush with cash.

05:45.930 --> 05:52.440
You can chose how much space you want to use from these hard disk to be used as a flash with recast

05:52.810 --> 05:54.290
as of its.

05:54.660 --> 06:01.590
And of course you can chose this one but you can leave it like that to use it automatically by the operating

06:01.590 --> 06:02.260
system.

06:02.310 --> 06:09.900
And as we know we use the monster as the driver of this virtual machine store it in our external storage

06:10.270 --> 06:17.820
the extent masalas other we have are flush with cash J.B. use it so you don't need to change this value

06:17.930 --> 06:18.510
into.

06:18.570 --> 06:27.920
You really need it then to discommode this option right now is not unbeatable because this driver is

06:27.920 --> 06:35.170
use it in a pot on your machine but lets try to get another one to see this option right.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.190
So in the next video we'll talk about this more.
