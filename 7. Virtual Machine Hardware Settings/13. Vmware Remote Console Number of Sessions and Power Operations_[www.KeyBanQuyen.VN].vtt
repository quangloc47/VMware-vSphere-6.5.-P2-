WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:01.460
Elegant.

00:01.640 --> 00:06.110
So as we saw in the preview one that we can connect I just be device.

00:06.170 --> 00:15.320
Also we can connect some PC device some shade it busy some other device in our Hulst to the vitriol

00:15.320 --> 00:16.340
machine actually.

00:16.430 --> 00:22.610
But of course you shall take your phone when you use those option that's mean you connect a physical

00:22.910 --> 00:25.450
device to a video machine.

00:25.610 --> 00:32.930
You will start having problem draw the emotion the fault and the negotiation of the video machine from

00:32.930 --> 00:37.010
house to another host this virtual machine would be out of do.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.350
Dearest that's me.

00:38.590 --> 00:45.200
We're not going to be migrated but then we're thought walking or read some specific device that will

00:45.200 --> 00:51.140
be able to let your émigrés a virtual machine even it is connected to our physical device.

00:51.170 --> 00:59.360
But this is the specific device that you can do it's like our shared device between two different and

00:59.360 --> 01:00.110
tossed.

01:00.230 --> 01:02.780
You use it directly to the virtual machine.

01:02.930 --> 01:09.920
And when this virtual machine migrated from is I want to E-6 I do that is excite to also connect with

01:09.920 --> 01:13.660
that device that Tardieu PC device.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.150
So next we have the option.

01:16.220 --> 01:21.910
We talk about this option before the virtual machine to name the config file.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.620
Then do the working location then do get operating system.

01:26.630 --> 01:27.240
That's me.

01:27.370 --> 01:32.630
If you want to change the operation system or this machine machine you need to part of the new chals

01:32.840 --> 01:33.250
option.

01:33.360 --> 01:40.910
LEITHEAD then we have do VM where remote console option option will be available when you're out of

01:40.970 --> 01:42.040
the virtual machine.

01:42.170 --> 01:49.910
So that gives us look local to get operating system when the last remote user disconnected when the

01:49.910 --> 01:56.400
last user disconnected from this virtual machine VM where remote control will be located.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.070
That means one can't connect to this virtual machine.

01:59.080 --> 02:06.360
A lot you want to make this much your machine out of service or any reason the maximum number of station

02:06.670 --> 02:13.420
limits the number of Smoketown use connection to this virtual machine with 14.

02:13.580 --> 02:16.870
That's me and use a Konkan next to this virtual machine.

02:16.880 --> 02:24.720
If we see right here if we back on this virtual machine how the station right here it is connected through

02:24.860 --> 02:26.180
the web browser.

02:26.180 --> 02:35.010
Then if we try to open Troke our remote control like this one will take a little time to show in our

02:35.010 --> 02:35.500
room.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.900
So that is it.

02:38.900 --> 02:44.020
So no we have to use it connected to the same material machine like this one.

02:44.020 --> 02:49.310
Then if we go back for example and try to open another browser lash will console.

02:49.660 --> 02:57.500
So no we have a tree user connected to the virtual machine that if we try to open this one like that.

02:57.760 --> 03:05.720
So a model can connect to this virtual machine as you just here we have four users connect to the sim

03:05.810 --> 03:10.530
virtual machine like this one and this one right.

03:12.030 --> 03:18.390
As you see to use it from being Walkstation and to from do web browser.

03:18.660 --> 03:25.860
So the idea here that we can connect to this virtual machine for the console or for the user for example

03:25.950 --> 03:27.710
1 and 2.

03:28.080 --> 03:34.930
So we can connect up to 14 consoles to this virtual machine.

03:35.010 --> 03:42.720
So if we try to edit the seating again so if all balks at the option right again then if you want to

03:42.720 --> 03:48.390
limit the number of connection to this virtual machine we need to support our virtual machine then we

03:48.390 --> 03:52.310
change it to one or two Macsyma station.

03:52.420 --> 03:58.120
They don't have the VM where the truth is you chose the option or just put on.

03:58.260 --> 04:02.450
Of course we need to part of the virtual machine to be able to choose that option.

04:04.370 --> 04:08.770
So a click but what often gets quickly OK.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.960
So the virtual machine will be powered off.

04:13.150 --> 04:19.370
But is it not if we chose it it is sitting for the VM option.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.240
Like that.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.650
No we have the option to change the number.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.130
We can change it to.

04:28.270 --> 04:36.790
For example one station or for example to look the operating system when the lustrum would use are disconnected.

04:36.800 --> 04:45.550
I'd say that they we have a VM where we can change this bottom from shut down the power of or from the

04:45.550 --> 04:50.170
default it's shutdown Dienste response.

04:50.180 --> 04:57.060
If you want to stand or suspend guest or the default is to spend then power on this option.

04:57.080 --> 05:03.710
There's not a lot will to change it because by default this option meaning our own then we have to restart

05:03.890 --> 05:12.340
all eristic rested the virtual machine as Minya power off then your power on the restart will be shut

05:12.340 --> 05:16.180
down then power on the rest it would be powered off.

05:16.220 --> 05:25.430
Then I'll work on them when we're to script after power and on after resuming before it is pending before

05:25.430 --> 05:26.890
shutdown etc..

05:27.100 --> 05:34.320
So you enable or disable some option or the VM Ware tool to upgrade check and upgrade VM which will

05:34.320 --> 05:41.780
be before each arm on this option that's me will try to upgrade which will every time you power on your

05:41.780 --> 05:44.950
machine but this is not recommended the entire time.

05:45.020 --> 05:47.840
Synchronises gets time to host.

05:47.900 --> 05:55.150
If you want to psychoanalyzed time of this virtual machine we host as we did we do Isak's I host.
