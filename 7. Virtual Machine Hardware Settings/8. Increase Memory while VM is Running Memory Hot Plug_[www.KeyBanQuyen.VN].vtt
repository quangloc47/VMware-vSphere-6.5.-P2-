Them if we try to get the rain like that.

00:05.460 --> 00:11.780
So we go here for example Changi from Harvard you go by the trees you go right all the ones you go by

00:11.780 --> 00:13.680
is 1 0 2 4.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.040
So I like that we click OK.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.370
It will complete the virtual machine.

00:18.530 --> 00:22.510
And if we are back right there we'll see our new updates here.

00:22.520 --> 00:26.360
Is it OK we need to refresh when any update happens.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.500
Do you see Modu memory.

00:28.780 --> 00:31.490
Meaning you have something other to do mid-morning.

00:34.380 --> 00:39.270
You need to reboot this one to to do new memory available.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.240
Of course the operation system.

00:41.240 --> 00:47.140
No I have one gigabyte of the rest but it can't show up in the right here.

00:47.430 --> 00:52.960
So if we go back to the date of this machine I tell you see that it's tough to see.

00:53.070 --> 00:58.990
And once you go by it or frame it's to use one gigabyte or three without any problem.

00:59.070 --> 01:04.130
Even if we have an overload in more than you advice it would work without any problem.

01:04.380 --> 01:07.600
And the machine will use the new brain.
