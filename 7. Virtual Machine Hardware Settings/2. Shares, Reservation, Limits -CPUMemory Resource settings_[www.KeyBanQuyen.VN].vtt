WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:04.020
So in Naples this one in our Windows 7.

00:04.020 --> 00:08.280
So if we click on this one like that it is sitting.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.900
This machine is powered on like you see right there.

00:13.870 --> 00:20.870
It's up in a little browser like that's.

00:21.090 --> 00:31.790
Then we try to do it it's sitting of this battery and machine.

00:31.830 --> 00:39.960
So no we already check the Enable sipping hot plugging and memory hot plugging.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.730
I LRAD enable them.

00:41.730 --> 00:50.640
So in this case I have the ability to change the number of Sibiu for this virtual machine but the situation

00:50.640 --> 00:58.290
right that we have is that this machine have spewed but only one core and other information that we

00:58.290 --> 01:07.080
can't change the core sockets because this is illogical to give our machine another caught parsel kids

01:07.110 --> 01:10.840
because they already have the sockets available.

01:10.950 --> 01:14.080
And it is used by the video machine.

01:14.220 --> 01:19.980
So here we have only one socket but we have the option to choose to spew.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.720
But we do not have the option to choose one.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.940
Another rule that we have right.

01:26.280 --> 01:36.430
That's when we want to change to see piu we only have one direction for adding more supply.

01:36.450 --> 01:37.660
We can't.

01:37.810 --> 01:44.060
Mine is Sibiu or resource for our virtual machine that is bolted on it is a virtual machine have once

01:44.060 --> 01:45.890
said we can't tell you to do.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.390
But we can't go to the opposite direction changes from 2 to 1.

01:51.720 --> 01:58.000
So we only have one detection to upgrade to spew and not minimize it.

01:58.020 --> 02:04.460
So is it a virtual machine but a virtual machine depend on a number of lessons that see beyond the house

02:04.740 --> 02:08.650
and the number of people supported by the guest operating system.

02:08.690 --> 02:14.410
And when we chose an operation system right here that's support only to spew.

02:14.670 --> 02:23.580
We now have the only option to chose to spew if another operating system can support at 16.

02:23.880 --> 02:30.510
We have the option right here about 16 speed so all of our mission right it is integration about this

02:30.600 --> 02:31.670
one right here.

02:34.050 --> 02:35.870
Then we have the capacity.

02:35.900 --> 02:43.020
Of course the option is not available in it's really part of the virtual machine then we have a reservation.

02:43.160 --> 02:50.050
If you remember into a resource pool we talk about do a reservation for click on this one we have.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.400
Current value is zero.

02:51.410 --> 03:00.080
Maximum is five Jugheads for this virtual machine so we can reserve any value we want for example two

03:00.300 --> 03:01.830
gigahertz lega.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.330
That's mean no we reserve two gigabytes for this virtual machine.

03:06.470 --> 03:13.510
And this you should take careful when you do it because when there's virtual machine power it off it's

03:13.520 --> 03:18.110
still reserved to ziggurats of the Sibiu for this virtual machine.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.690
And that will give you a limited resource for the other virtual machine.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.090
So all of recommend it to give it a zero.

03:26.230 --> 03:34.520
Intill do one or offer an application require you to reserve a specific number of spew and run for the

03:34.610 --> 03:38.450
operating system and for the obligation then you can change it.

03:38.540 --> 03:46.130
Then you have the limits as the same as the resource limits from zero or from intimate that's mean there's

03:46.160 --> 03:49.970
not have any limits for this imaging machine.

03:49.970 --> 03:57.650
But if you want to limit this one to a specific value you can add it right there by example for

04:00.250 --> 04:00.990
Gerhard's

04:04.270 --> 04:13.270
like that so it will be limited to four figureheads for this machine can't use in fall overloading then

04:13.270 --> 04:17.080
the share as the share that we did in the resource pool.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.840
We give it normal low heights.

04:19.900 --> 04:29.800
So the same prize is 4000 normal etc. so the should work as the same as we did in the pool.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.530
But up to a bit of a virtual machine.

04:32.680 --> 04:40.630
That means the host will separate resouce across this share configuration between two different virtual

04:40.630 --> 04:41.660
machine and do shit.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.910
That's good.

04:42.910 --> 04:48.670
So for example Charles hides and all the other machine have no sharing this virtual machine.

04:48.670 --> 04:54.940
We get to high performance of the resource of the host.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.140
Another option that we have right there to keep this as normal.

05:00.620 --> 05:01.280
This will be

05:05.390 --> 05:05.980
zero.

05:06.010 --> 05:12.480
And this would be to me like that's the NAACP idea.

05:12.510 --> 05:22.330
Musk this option is a little complex but it's something that's you connected to between machine to do.

05:22.980 --> 05:29.120
That actually that's I mean you connect this virtual machine to the idea of these C.P because we have

05:29.120 --> 05:36.770
some application or some license of application or operating system license that is connected we do

05:37.130 --> 05:45.600
id of the CPA or the ideal of the modern world but not Orac lessons have a connection we do see.

05:45.920 --> 05:56.540
I mean this Oracle application you can install it in our machine that have our ID and do what I could

05:56.540 --> 06:03.440
will work perfectly but if you try to install is inside another machine that have a different ID or

06:03.440 --> 06:10.430
do you this Oracle Application we're not going to work until you buy a license for that application.

06:10.550 --> 06:17.420
And if you remember when we create some rule about a is for example we want to make our virtual machine

06:17.840 --> 06:24.140
to always run in a specific cost because we have our license only connected what the speed of the host

06:24.410 --> 06:25.530
we are.

06:25.760 --> 06:34.340
There is a rule that please this virtual machine always should or must must always run in the host number

06:34.340 --> 06:38.720
one because we have our license connected with that horse.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.200
So this is the idea of ID.

06:41.330 --> 06:45.470
Of course this will be available only when your power on your machine.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.630
Then we have hardware virtualization.

06:47.650 --> 06:51.120
Those aren't all the new power of the vision machine.

06:51.200 --> 06:59.650
So the hardware virtualization thats me expose hardware virtualization to the guest.

06:59.720 --> 07:09.270
So if you remember when we enable the virtualization in our bios of each of those ESX I host that mean

07:09.410 --> 07:19.430
we make the step to be virtually the did by a software call it is x I host and do same we did when we

07:19.640 --> 07:27.100
created our virtual machine like this one when we create a virtual machine inside of workstation we

07:27.140 --> 07:34.080
already enable speed in the BIOS to be use it as a victory speech.

07:34.250 --> 07:41.260
So this is the same if we want for example to install a virtualization program inside this virtual machine

07:41.780 --> 07:49.310
we need to enable the hardware between Zeeshan that's mean a nested vitriol or a nested virtual machine

07:49.340 --> 07:50.950
inside your machine.

07:51.060 --> 07:57.050
But in a virtual machine inside and your machine the virtual machine inside this one and so on Ansal

07:57.290 --> 08:01.610
It's called nested virtual machine.

08:01.610 --> 08:07.970
This option when you're enabled this one you would be able to install any highborn user software inside

08:08.050 --> 08:08.650
this.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.350
Windows 7 for example.

08:10.370 --> 08:18.240
The Walkstation Hyper-V or the virtual box and create a virtual machine inside this virtual machine.

08:18.270 --> 08:21.790
This is the option that we have performance control also.

08:21.940 --> 08:25.040
It is illusion about victory or speed performance.

08:25.100 --> 08:31.680
Then we have to sit you in situation that's mean the relation is to.

08:31.750 --> 08:37.460
And and you for this virtual machine we have the option automatic.

08:37.880 --> 08:43.480
So you see that right has some detail about its needs.

08:43.920 --> 08:52.110
You will use the physical stick you and end you of the host are very good.

08:52.500 --> 09:00.060
So you see software Scipion and you use software for awestricken States and individualization all you

09:00.060 --> 09:06.390
will is the hardware that actually does mean you're connected to spew that lead to the machine as this

09:06.390 --> 09:15.930
one is until I m d for action suits the virtualization and swapper and situation or you make them all

09:15.930 --> 09:16.150
up.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.660
How do the words mean you're connected to a lot of the stupid end to the virtual machine.

09:21.690 --> 09:22.360
They actually.

09:22.440 --> 09:33.150
So we have options software or hardware and software and and hardware and the so of course we always

09:33.150 --> 09:42.330
leave this option Automattic into our obligation of lot of us to our question is do you and you as a

09:42.330 --> 09:47.000
software or hardware but always Nick the much really.

09:47.190 --> 09:56.160
So this is a quick idea about the speed and the same for the Memali it's work as the same as the hot

09:56.340 --> 09:56.840
plug.

09:57.030 --> 10:02.540
And we have the option to change the virtual machine configuration so you stay right here.

10:02.910 --> 10:05.320
Minimum is 500 megabytes.

10:06.170 --> 10:13.760
And the default for Windows 7 is totally goodbye's and does Windows 7 Professional 64 bits can support

10:13.760 --> 10:19.180
up to 1 2 8 gigabytes of frame for the best performance.

10:19.190 --> 10:25.370
You give it three gigabytes he give you that best performs for this but your machine is 3G gobshites

10:25.430 --> 10:32.320
the minimum is how do you know why the default is do and the maximum is 100 gigabyte.

10:32.360 --> 10:38.780
Also if we back to this option right here and change the Windows 7 to our windows server of course this

10:38.780 --> 10:45.830
value will be changed from maximum 1 2 8 to another number that's called supported by the operation

10:45.950 --> 10:47.250
system.

10:47.300 --> 10:52.220
So also we have a reservation if you remember the reservation for this virtual machine we control.

10:52.220 --> 10:57.310
For example gigabytes for this between machine will always reserve it to this one

11:00.580 --> 11:07.310
chicken right here that these reservation is not available for this machine because the maximum is 1

11:08.090 --> 11:15.660
gigabytes which is up for no then reserve Arcas memory on lock.

11:15.690 --> 11:20.070
This option will be available when your power of the virtual machine.

11:20.080 --> 11:20.730
So that's.

11:20.920 --> 11:27.650
If we give to this virtual machine three gigabytes will reserve reserved for this much machine.

11:28.600 --> 11:34.060
Then if we give it 4 bytes for example for this virtual machine it will reserve for advice.

11:34.180 --> 11:42.640
Then the limits are the same as the resource pool limit limits etc. then do share the normal the low

11:42.760 --> 11:44.320
and the heights.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.710
So it's the same as the CPI.

11:47.720 --> 11:52.860
So next we'll discover do hard drive this and about it.

11:52.890 --> 11:53.710
So soon the next big.
