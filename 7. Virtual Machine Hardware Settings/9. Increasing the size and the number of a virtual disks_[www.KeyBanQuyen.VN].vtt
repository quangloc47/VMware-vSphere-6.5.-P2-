WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:01.290
So the same.

00:01.290 --> 00:10.680
For example if we go back later and we try to argue hard disk if we check a good hard disk in this machine

00:11.490 --> 00:18.060
and have one hard disk with 24 gigabytes so we back to this machine again.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.520
We try.

00:19.590 --> 00:25.330
It is sitting.

00:25.470 --> 00:34.740
Then of course you can upgrade the size of just one example let's give it about two to five like this

00:34.740 --> 00:37.490
one click OK to see what we want.

00:39.140 --> 00:39.810
That is it.

00:39.830 --> 00:46.260
If we back to the salon with task complaints it will disconnected when it's reconnected.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.930
This option is only for the web browser that we need to refresh the package to reconnect to the machine.

00:53.180 --> 01:00.920
But by using our console like this one like a VM workstation we do not refresh it automatically detects

01:00.920 --> 01:01.850
this one.

01:01.850 --> 01:09.370
So how does it know we need to make our refresh like this one refresh.

01:09.410 --> 01:14.640
Is this another 11 gigabytes is available in disk number but zero.

01:14.720 --> 01:15.200
Of course.

01:15.200 --> 01:21.260
No we can't extend the volume like that this one.

01:21.510 --> 01:22.310
That is it not.

01:22.340 --> 01:26.120
It is extended from 24 as you go by.

01:26.330 --> 01:27.980
Thirty five bytes.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.340
So it works perfectly without any problem.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.400
Operating systems work without any problem.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.060
Then we try to add another hard disk

01:39.270 --> 01:47.760
like that which was new hard disk hard give it to configuration for example this one take two teachers

01:47.870 --> 01:51.150
gigabytes which was start with the virtual machine.

01:51.180 --> 01:59.310
We chose ten provision then if we want to make any a specification of this one OK

02:02.850 --> 02:04.650
reasons us several commanded the following.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.450
Datastore for the virtual machine a recommendation for virtual machine.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.600
We didn't say that the star cluster are linked together and must either be accepted or rejected as a

02:15.600 --> 02:16.350
group.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.720
Click upload accommodation if these recommendations are acceptable.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.020
So hey give me a recommendation to use the land want to start the new disk.

02:25.170 --> 02:27.550
So let's apply the recommendation.

02:27.550 --> 02:30.030
It's not a problem in this situation.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.450
So the stock reacted quickly.

02:33.580 --> 02:40.100
If we back right here and try to refresh you see before we do it is automatically detected.

02:40.360 --> 02:47.980
So no we have this one ready to be used of course in any steelies disk to use it.

02:48.270 --> 02:48.990
OK.

02:51.450 --> 02:57.380
Then you can create a new hard disk in this machine without any problem.

02:57.450 --> 03:02.150
Last week the option as it is next.

03:02.190 --> 03:02.950
Finish.

03:03.150 --> 03:12.970
And then your hard disk will be formatted and new disk driver you can't see it's on display.

03:14.650 --> 03:17.610
We have only one local disk.

03:17.790 --> 03:27.230
I've started to form my thoughts complete you will see it's use in the form of the US but also it will

03:27.410 --> 03:29.040
show up after a moment.

03:29.130 --> 03:35.420
So this is the idea of a different option that we have to add any hardware that we won't understand

03:35.420 --> 03:35.750
for.

03:35.760 --> 03:42.040
To use B.K. for the CD DVD drive or or any option that we have right.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.720
We can't change anything.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.850
And we'll see that it will take effect in about it on your machine.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.720
So is it in your disk.

03:52.750 --> 03:56.880
It's perfectly in this machine and here is it.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.740
And we check this one has it.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.340
No one is perfect.

04:01.670 --> 04:06.270
So see in the next video we need another feature of the Mystery Machine.
