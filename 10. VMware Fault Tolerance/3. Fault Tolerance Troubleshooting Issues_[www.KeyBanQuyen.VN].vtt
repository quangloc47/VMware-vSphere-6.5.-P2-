WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:02.340
Help again.

00:02.600 --> 00:08.510
So let's try to enable our full Terrans in our virtual machine.

00:08.990 --> 00:13.420
So we try to enable our full roles in our virtual machine.

00:13.430 --> 00:19.030
You simply go to the virtual machine uploaded on or about it of a virtual machine.

00:19.430 --> 00:20.770
It's not a portal.

00:21.170 --> 00:25.370
You click on it and you got to the full dose.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.360
And we have some options right there.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.190
The first one that we have is three or four.

00:31.700 --> 00:39.040
So I created some older massage to suit a different order that you can get when you try to enable default

00:39.040 --> 00:40.760
arose in our virtual machine.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.200
So if we click on this one you'll see some difference right there.

00:45.650 --> 00:51.070
So let's try to convert them one by one and get two different solution available.

00:51.110 --> 00:56.490
So the first one is super hot Plug-In is not supported for this virtual machine.

00:56.660 --> 00:57.400
That's me.

00:57.590 --> 01:01.150
When you want to create a full to the last in a virtual machine.

01:01.430 --> 01:06.080
This virtual machine should not have are a hot plug.

01:06.200 --> 01:12.400
You remember when we talk a hot plug that mean about it on your machine can update to spew or the rim

01:12.440 --> 01:14.500
of this virtual machine without any problem.

01:14.720 --> 01:22.310
So the photo is not were to work if you have this option enable in the virtual machine that's me.

01:22.430 --> 01:30.050
Imagine that we had our mirror a machine between two holes and then you try to upgrade to secure this

01:30.050 --> 01:34.600
virtual machine by another Sibiu or Abu-Ghraib dream.

01:34.610 --> 01:44.690
So how do signon that a virtual machine can know that you have others on your you who will get the privilege

01:44.780 --> 01:51.610
to do so you can do the virtual machine to get more support from the host or more for prob the guest

01:51.610 --> 01:54.160
host is I number two.

01:54.860 --> 02:02.870
So logically do hot plugin can lead you to make photodiodes inside a virtual machine.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.530
So let's try to fix it.

02:04.580 --> 02:11.330
And to do it of course if you remember the hot plugging unit took power of the video machine go it it's

02:11.330 --> 02:17.490
sitting and in the seat view you need to disable the hot plugging.

02:17.750 --> 02:23.050
So we got this new we deserve it enables a hot plug in.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.350
They do the same for the memory.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.700
Ok then we click OK the updates are.

02:32.070 --> 02:33.260
It's your machine.

02:33.350 --> 02:39.520
Then if we try to go on chose true on water as you see Option one is gone.

02:39.700 --> 02:46.830
They we have device use controller use or control that is not supported and that's massaged.

02:47.030 --> 02:54.190
But I mean our virtual machine connected with our U.S. port if you're trying to use a or ass with the

02:54.200 --> 03:01.230
same virtual machine in a modern host it is illogical to a machine from a different host connect to

03:01.230 --> 03:01.960
the same.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.140
Be key.

03:03.320 --> 03:10.840
That's mean if you plug us in this virtual machine that actually from the host It is illogical.

03:10.890 --> 03:16.280
That's the signal to revert your machine or the mirror a virtual machine also connected to the same

03:16.400 --> 03:17.580
US became.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.200
So we need to disable the biggie.

03:21.290 --> 03:25.650
Also the various CD-ROM has a backing type that is not supported.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.460
But I mean this virtual machine connects to the city around.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.030
And it is signon to to your machine from a model.

03:33.250 --> 03:38.250
I hope to connect to the same city there all of the primary one.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.380
So we need to fix this problem.

03:40.390 --> 03:49.120
We're back to the heated seats in we need to go to the city so the city we need to disconnect this virtual

03:49.140 --> 03:55.450
machine from the house CD or client CD No matter it is connected you need to disconnect all those information

03:55.470 --> 03:55.700
right.

03:55.740 --> 04:01.770
For example the data is all but exists in the data base of I that has.

04:01.860 --> 04:07.770
But your machine mirror or virtual machine can't get access to do look that sort of this one and get

04:07.770 --> 04:08.510
to do Isel.

04:08.520 --> 04:15.960
Imagine also under the information that's hard this should be in shit it's trash and not in our local

04:15.960 --> 04:16.380
stores.

04:16.380 --> 04:22.070
This is one of the group you either didn't know all of it is so disconnected to CD-ROM.

04:22.170 --> 04:27.000
Then you got to do it because you need to do use control.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.240
So it click OK.

04:29.450 --> 04:34.140
So the configuration applied then we try to check if there are another error.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.240
So the turn on is work without any problem.

04:38.240 --> 04:45.890
So let's cancel this one and another that can happen if you didn't configure do for us in this E-6 I

04:45.890 --> 04:51.380
host for example do Windows 7 to exist in the I host number two.

04:51.500 --> 05:00.990
If you didn't enable the full dose from this place in my house number two if you tried to enable defaulters

05:01.130 --> 05:06.980
in this virtual machine you will get an error message that's Galut default configuration of the anti-Tea

05:07.040 --> 05:10.090
it X I want a VM lab that em up.

05:10.130 --> 05:17.330
Of course any decision is ESX I don't have a non-issue this year for the way to host to have a virtual

05:17.450 --> 05:20.910
Nic enabled for the last logging.

05:21.010 --> 05:27.620
That's when you should enable a full rules in at least one network adapter in the halls that have this

05:27.740 --> 05:29.040
virtual machine.

05:29.900 --> 05:38.530
So we have another kind of route let's try it with this one and we try to enable the fault in this one.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.140
So the same if you remember the device.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.680
You need to delete it for this virtual machine.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.190
Don't sit there on the road.

05:46.230 --> 05:51.470
Let's do this how does one use our control that is not supported.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.170
The controller uses for the hard disk is supported.

05:56.390 --> 06:05.870
How to fix this one we got two idiots sitting and the same as we did with us B-22 you speak.

06:05.900 --> 06:11.290
We need to disconnect the CD-ROM in the hard disk.

06:11.290 --> 06:12.490
This virtual machine.

06:12.520 --> 06:12.840
Use it.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.650
Windows XP sort by default.

06:14.680 --> 06:20.480
Each user id for the controller of the disk.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.110
So we need to use the scuzzy controller.

06:23.470 --> 06:32.670
If you use something like a one ID took the folder as would be available in this virtual machine into

06:33.230 --> 06:34.550
the control.

06:34.720 --> 06:42.070
So we fixed cost control of this hard disk with fixed CD-ROM with fixed us beat controls so I click

06:42.100 --> 06:45.130
OK the configuration on played

06:49.080 --> 06:52.120
OK then we try to enable do filter on.

06:52.170 --> 07:00.700
I get the full completion of it name has unissued steward vidual machine has one more snapshots or this

07:00.730 --> 07:02.310
Gadot need consolidate.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.930
But Meek is in competition for full protection.

07:07.300 --> 07:14.170
So another error that can happen in our fault is with a virtual machine that's the virtual machine should

07:14.170 --> 07:21.350
not have any snap shots in the virtual machine before you will be able to carry it up for two minutes.

07:21.760 --> 07:27.270
Also as the same logic the vision machine with a snapshot can't have our fault.

07:27.370 --> 07:32.340
But we all make our reverse back of that visual machine to a snapshot.

07:32.380 --> 07:38.560
The other visual machine will have a problem but with those same snapshots because the snapshot is not

07:38.620 --> 07:41.160
available for the secondary virtual machine.

07:41.320 --> 07:47.210
So to fix this one we go to the virtual machine we go to manage snapshot.

07:47.370 --> 07:52.600
You remember the section about the snapshot Menashe snapshot.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.400
Then we need to delete all the snapshots available if you have four or five.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.430
We need to delete them snapshot.

08:01.810 --> 08:05.170
We need to delete all the snapshots.

08:05.230 --> 08:10.670
So it will be automatically consolidated to do the latest editions so we click delete.

08:11.010 --> 08:12.840
Yes it will delete.

08:12.880 --> 08:13.420
Argh.

08:13.470 --> 08:18.540
Available snapshot.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.730
So how does it do in the same place that we are.

08:21.850 --> 08:28.000
Then we try to enable default and no default will work perfectly.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.170
So how does it.

08:29.170 --> 08:33.990
So next we'll try to create a filter for that yet machine Suunto next.
