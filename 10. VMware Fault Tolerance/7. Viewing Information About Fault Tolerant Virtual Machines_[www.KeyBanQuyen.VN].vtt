00:00.590 --> 00:04.510
Blogging so know what's happened before.

00:04.560 --> 00:05.270
What is x.

00:05.370 --> 00:09.840
I want bucks to live and the Fulton also will do its work.

00:09.870 --> 00:14.190
So if we check the full state or this mid-June machine.

00:14.580 --> 00:20.130
So if we don't retail you see Flatirons state not protected.

00:20.130 --> 00:21.960
Need a 7:30 p.m. That's me.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.010
This virtual machine indeed default.

00:25.080 --> 00:31.000
It's not protected and need are signon the virtual machine that's mean it can't front due to going to

00:31.000 --> 00:32.490
the virtual machine.

00:32.490 --> 00:38.880
So if we check it I want have to see the virtual machine it's empty.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.120
What's happening Ted.

00:40.300 --> 00:47.680
The height of ability McGeary to the virtual machine to Stigand do you want from this host to the host.

00:47.760 --> 00:53.370
If we check this one of course we're not going to put it right there because we have our video Windows

00:53.370 --> 00:54.010
XP.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.620
So I hate to see migrated to do is excite.

00:56.640 --> 01:04.260
Number three if we check writer we have Windows XP number for secondary Foret of of course it's part

01:04.320 --> 01:11.850
of because a configuration of Flatirons power and Segan to the between machine and the primary is X

01:11.880 --> 01:13.950
I want and Isak's I took it.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.380
So if you click on this one it will take us to the same virtual machine.

01:18.580 --> 01:25.410
Brimley virtual machine is bolted on and the subin do the virtual machine is powered off because it

01:25.410 --> 01:26.890
does not exist.

01:26.910 --> 01:30.400
So the state writer of the Flatirons is need.

01:30.490 --> 01:35.670
So you can do the VM virtual machine and the state is not protected.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.260
Of course it will take a little time to detect that.

01:38.330 --> 01:44.970
If I won back to life then it will migrate the signal to the virtual machine from E6.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.010
I agree to the original one head is it.

01:47.010 --> 01:47.910
It's gone.

01:47.940 --> 01:54.060
So if we take it because I want to sit under the virtual machine buck to do is X I want and it will

01:54.060 --> 01:56.520
take a little time if we check this one right.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.280
No we've found that it detects.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.670
So you a virtual machine.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.220
It will take a little time to detect that so you can do the virtual machine is available.

02:06.290 --> 02:07.800
Is what I want.

02:07.800 --> 02:13.280
Of course let's give it a little time or just refresh.

02:13.330 --> 02:20.840
Of course the Flatirons take a little time to check the new virtual machine and will update any difference

02:20.840 --> 02:23.650
between the primary one and the secondary one.

02:23.650 --> 02:30.610
For example the 7:31 was not available for one day or one hour and some change happened to dispatch

02:30.610 --> 02:33.180
your machine if you check but your machines still work.

02:33.310 --> 02:38.740
For example we had some data on webcam.

02:38.960 --> 02:47.240
Again that's when we make some updates on this virtual machine when it detects does it a virtual machine

02:47.270 --> 02:48.160
is available.

02:48.220 --> 02:55.190
Who will try to update the different change between the hey we're powered on to Siegman did you want

02:55.370 --> 02:57.920
to work to redo that embody one.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.510
So it will take a little time to complete the process.

03:01.580 --> 03:01.910
So.

03:01.930 --> 03:11.450
But Imrie everyone no exist in E6 I talk and I one have you can do the one that is it's still bolted

03:11.480 --> 03:11.780
up.

03:11.840 --> 03:17.810
It will take a little time for it on after making a different change.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.970
So what is it.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.350
Of course it needs a little time to work.

03:27.380 --> 03:36.370
Just give it a refresh.

03:36.460 --> 03:39.850
If we take it to being it's still available without any problem.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.210
If we check the state

04:02.320 --> 04:08.120
head is it you seek not protected and no in the process of starting that's mean.

04:08.190 --> 04:14.920
It detects the secondary virtual machine location it is x I won and it starting.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.770
If we take this one will find that it's starting right now.

04:20.160 --> 04:27.030
So it's still part of of course a little moment and it will be voted on and this exclamation mark will

04:27.290 --> 04:34.560
delete it because the protection will be available for on state will be protected because we have the

04:34.560 --> 04:40.690
primary and secondary between machine available in the environments it just give it a little time.

04:40.700 --> 04:46.580
Of course the vision machine still work being still available without any problem.

04:49.770 --> 04:56.520
Kate starting this refresh to check into your state.

04:56.520 --> 05:02.800
It's not part it on check the first one.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.380
Still part of

05:09.810 --> 05:11.660
so I think it starts.

05:11.680 --> 05:20.250
Follow it on.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.750
So you see no it's become protected.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.420
That's mean.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.200
The second division machine is available.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.450
So it is bounded on and other massage deleted.

05:30.550 --> 05:34.270
No we are protected by the student Ravager machine.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.720
This is what I want.

05:35.890 --> 05:42.870
And look bandwidth which use is zero kilobytes of course if we have some data that will be updated into

05:43.630 --> 05:48.080
your machine then the connectivity is still available without any problem.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.760
The virtual machine still available without any problem.

05:52.780 --> 06:00.880
So this is the benefit of the full loss and of course the full Tarrance have a zero down time division

06:00.880 --> 06:03.520
machine still working without any problem.

06:03.520 --> 06:10.360
Also if we have a problem in the Isak's I won that one the top three do Sundaravej machine will become

06:10.360 --> 06:16.150
the primary and we'll give you another missile right there that you are not protected and the state

06:16.160 --> 06:22.930
rights will be challenged and not protected when the secondary virtual machine be available will challenge

06:22.940 --> 06:29.620
are not protected and starting their windows division machine pouted on you would be protected without

06:29.680 --> 06:34.140
any problem you're still Hairlock bent which is about 1 megabytes.

06:34.180 --> 06:41.070
That's mean it's updates to do information between want and you can do the one.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.510
So we'll see in the next video for more information.
