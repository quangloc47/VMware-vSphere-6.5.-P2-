00:01.780 --> 00:10.320
Blogging so after enabling the full blast in this virtual machine and you see that it's still work without

00:10.350 --> 00:11.600
any problem.

00:12.690 --> 00:21.220
No we need to know were is it just the virtual machine that we created all the fault in the last Have

00:21.240 --> 00:22.260
you checked this one.

00:22.280 --> 00:30.970
Exist in X I want and we don't see any delay virtual machine right hand and that's logically the secondary

00:31.030 --> 00:31.990
virtual machine.

00:31.990 --> 00:37.840
We're not going to show operator because it is already exists as a virtual machine.

00:38.080 --> 00:44.710
So how we see the going do the virtual machine we've got to do E-6 I want in this situation is I want

00:44.710 --> 00:46.500
Hovda Windows XP.

00:46.550 --> 00:54.250
But what we've got is X I want and in the virtual machine we check right there we see that this virtual

00:54.250 --> 00:57.490
machine Windows XP for Khaled's primary.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.260
This is a virtual machine that we use right now.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.210
If you click on it it will take us to do virtual machine.

01:03.340 --> 01:05.390
And this is ours are Primanti.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.600
So the stick to the virtual machine that we can feek when we enable do.

01:10.690 --> 01:13.050
Ease in E6 I talk.

01:13.180 --> 01:19.150
So we got to the Isak's I took and we see those we have another virtual machine exists solely to win

01:19.180 --> 01:21.790
xp for signon diary.

01:22.060 --> 01:22.480
That's me.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.270
This is the secondary virtual machine of do what.

01:26.310 --> 01:32.930
So if we click on it to check the option of this one it will take us to the same virtual machine.

01:33.640 --> 01:42.840
So no it's the same virtual machine exists in the house running in Isak's I want and Indu I chalk up

01:42.850 --> 01:44.310
to the same time.

01:44.500 --> 01:53.480
Also if we try to check that I start up this one the line number two if you remember which creates the

01:53.480 --> 01:54.690
virtual machine.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.660
4 into Ladenburg drop her visits.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.400
So these exist in lunch.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.880
Number two if we check luck Number one we see those we have Win XP.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.450
Number four it's exists in double.

02:08.540 --> 02:14.020
Learn the hard drive and the data exists in this one and the same exists in the lot.

02:14.040 --> 02:20.920
Number two let's meet in obstetrician that we have of 5 in London broil.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.430
Hey keep connected to land number two without any problem.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.400
How does it do that.

02:25.470 --> 02:29.060
And do a vindictive fight exists in this one.

02:29.220 --> 02:38.010
So the same in London but so we have on a high ability of the military and machine that exists in to

02:38.160 --> 02:43.380
shit it Stosh if something wrong happened to one of those storage we have a model one of you to put

02:43.380 --> 02:51.990
into Seguin's trust and also exist in to E6 I host if something happened is X I want it keep working

02:52.010 --> 02:54.030
from is X number two.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.120
So there's a machine running into is X I Holst's number one in the right environment.

03:00.160 --> 03:07.380
It's running right now and the end is X I calls them br1 because this is do we want that we walk on

03:07.380 --> 03:16.430
these so we'll going to try to make this victory machine out of service and see what will happen to

03:16.430 --> 03:23.180
the virtual machine like what we did in do the height of ability when we power off our hands that have

03:23.180 --> 03:24.620
a virtual machine.

03:24.620 --> 03:30.950
We see that David your machine disconnects it then it start rebooted again but no as we want to have

03:31.040 --> 03:33.680
zero downtime Let's check.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.580
Do for us what we're going to do.

03:36.800 --> 03:44.140
So for that we going to do being to check the availability of the virtual machine Windows XP.

03:44.150 --> 03:44.900
Number four.

03:45.050 --> 03:48.500
So you see this is the IP address of this machine.

03:48.680 --> 03:57.800
So we're going to send a ping to this if be one 15 and we'll make it ultimately to checked the ability

03:57.800 --> 03:59.420
of this virtual machine.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.420
So you see it is available right now.

04:02.780 --> 04:09.070
So if we check the Windows XP number four it has it's work perfect.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.440
Let's try to mix some editing.

04:12.470 --> 04:16.510
This is a first of full reliance

04:19.310 --> 04:20.030
like that.

04:20.180 --> 04:20.630
That's me.

04:20.650 --> 04:29.200
This virtual machine is work without any problem and exist in ethics I want and we see that if something

04:29.200 --> 04:30.730
wrong happened to it is x.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.910
I wonder what will happen to this virtual machine.

04:34.240 --> 04:40.850
So I will go and try to power of do Isak's I want to create our problem right.

04:42.300 --> 04:53.210
So this is Isak's I want I try to while we're off of course it will take a little time.

04:53.310 --> 05:00.260
But one of and we check that the virtual machine is still available without any problem.

05:03.810 --> 05:07.170
So what is it you see the E6 I want is out of service.

05:07.410 --> 05:10.080
And you see it's our little time.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.240
Then it's back to the work without any problem.

05:13.290 --> 05:18.990
If we check the virtual machine of course we need to refresh but the console right here is still available.

05:19.050 --> 05:24.560
The console that connects directly to the virtual machine is still available only the browser does have

05:24.570 --> 05:25.540
that's easy.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.610
So the virtual machines still work.

05:27.780 --> 05:32.840
The file still open and that is what I want is out of service.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.640
The connectivity still available without any problem.

05:37.850 --> 05:40.420
So let's check what's happened right there.

05:40.520 --> 05:47.910
The full tolerance McGlade the connection from the windows XP and before that exist in it.

05:47.960 --> 05:53.760
I want to do Windows XP for that exist in six numbers or so.

05:53.870 --> 05:54.400
No.

05:54.410 --> 06:02.370
When we click on the Windows machine it show as he asks I talk if we try to check do is I do.

06:02.420 --> 06:05.720
That's how our secondary virtual machine.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.310
No it's become our Brimley virtual machine.

06:09.440 --> 06:16.850
Then if we check this one that was before it does not show any tank inside this because it is disconnected.

06:18.470 --> 06:22.730
So no you see that's the Windows XP.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.810
And before that was secondary become our primary.

06:26.870 --> 06:31.720
And you see right here another massage of course we can check this optimises Rhonda.

06:31.770 --> 06:37.310
And when you do it in virtual machine for nonstate Changi that means something will happen to this virtual

06:37.310 --> 06:37.670
machine.

06:37.670 --> 06:42.700
You need to check your environment to know what's happening.

06:42.710 --> 06:47.900
So this is an example of the fault in our environment.

06:47.910 --> 06:54.760
So next we'll try to power on the host and see what will happen again with the full totals.

06:54.830 --> 06:55.710
So we seem to be.
