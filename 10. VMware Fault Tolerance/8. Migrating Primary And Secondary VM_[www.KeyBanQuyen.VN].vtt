00:01.600 --> 00:02.360
Blogging.

00:02.610 --> 00:06.630
So let's see the other option that we have as quick as possible.

00:06.750 --> 00:12.360
We have to turn off the full can that's mean we want to disable the fold put it in his virtual machine.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.270
So what will happen to it will going to related to secondary virtual machine.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.850
And if I host Number one it will be deleted.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.700
So it will keep only with one virtual machine.

00:22.890 --> 00:28.020
So if we dream of we'll be delays this one didn't have to spend for instance.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.200
But I mean we can't respond to faltering nodes in this machine.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.870
If something wrong happened to the money what this vision machine would be about it.

00:35.910 --> 00:44.610
If indeed we enable do faltered and then it start working again without deleting do the secondary Vittoria

00:44.700 --> 00:49.970
machine then of course the red filters when you see spam you can't chals reason.

00:50.100 --> 00:55.780
Then we have mid-grade Siegman duty virtual machine that's made the secondary virtual machine that's

00:55.890 --> 00:59.060
configurator to exist in the location.

00:59.100 --> 01:07.810
E6 one if I want out of service the secondary will be not available until i want back to life.

01:07.830 --> 01:14.550
Then the photo of this virtual machine we did this is X I want available then it check if there are

01:14.920 --> 01:17.100
the second machine available.

01:17.640 --> 01:23.330
Of course you can chose the photo and then migrate the quandary that you want to change.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.230
I want to because I want.

01:25.410 --> 01:28.920
Of course you can't change the stars because the stars.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.390
It's not at the level of height of ability.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.930
When we chose the second revision machine exists in a different plan than the virtual machine.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.280
It's not in relation about photo ops.

01:42.300 --> 01:47.850
It just a recommendation that's tried two of which are the same secondary and primitive virtual machine

01:47.850 --> 01:49.270
in the same shit.

01:49.440 --> 01:56.930
But if something wrong happened to the storage number one and the storage number to do this the full

01:56.930 --> 02:00.370
tracks were not willing to help you out delivery of the storage.

02:00.510 --> 02:05.080
So it's work only at the level of two brain or is.

02:05.100 --> 02:12.630
I order resource only so we can't charge the resource on this machine machine salt the secondary virtual

02:12.630 --> 02:18.540
machine exists in is what I want so we can't chill's is excite or of course there are compatible issues

02:18.600 --> 02:20.110
that need your attention.

02:20.170 --> 02:27.780
Show the design the virtual machine in the same filterless bear cannot be on the same house because

02:27.780 --> 02:30.110
the primary won't exist in Iowa.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.200
I want.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.880
So we can't distinguish diplomatic indices.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.050
Yes I do.

02:36.140 --> 02:42.080
Because we if something happened to do it I don't we're going to last to virtual machine imagery and

02:42.090 --> 02:43.000
testimony.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.580
So we need to chose to work on.

02:45.590 --> 02:52.160
Of course we can leave it at the first one where it's on the problem about her debate because of the

02:52.170 --> 02:53.060
VM Ware.

02:53.270 --> 02:54.480
It's not a problem.

02:54.710 --> 03:01.760
Then you can chose the tour the one next and Skidder motion or do that motion right now.

03:02.330 --> 03:06.750
Also you can migrate to the one we chose for example like that.

03:06.770 --> 03:12.320
We want to make sure it does but you must of course do same with the full the motion is not available

03:12.350 --> 03:17.570
at the storage migration or Wimbush an evolving storage is not available for virtual machine that is

03:17.680 --> 03:19.040
for the.

03:19.340 --> 03:27.050
So next of course you can chose one of course we can't integrate this want to do is buy one we can chose

03:27.140 --> 03:30.600
number two or number three without any problem.

03:30.950 --> 03:37.190
Of course the secondary one does not send the bees because the herd the bees getting from to we want.

03:37.190 --> 03:42.860
That's why we get our odor right here when we check it Ixion and proceed to signal to the.

03:42.890 --> 03:50.000
So next then we chose the network is the same the signal program does not allow you to chose a network

03:50.000 --> 03:56.240
because the network manager to buy pre-money want to sue when they don't want it just for our problem

03:56.240 --> 03:57.770
happened to do it.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.590
That's a hostile primary virtual machine.

04:00.590 --> 04:07.720
So Skidder the motion with the highest priority next and finish and the emotion will start.

04:07.790 --> 04:14.000
But like the virtual machine still available and the connectivity is still available like that you see

04:14.000 --> 04:17.320
do a relocation of the virtual machine from Isak's.

04:17.320 --> 04:24.220
I know what to do is excite number three and the Fourth there are still work without any problem.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.070
That is it virtual machines don't work without any problem.

04:29.070 --> 04:34.440
Only a little time to relocate or migrate to Windows XP.

04:34.470 --> 04:42.820
Number Four money from the horse E-6 I to do is fix by 3 in the same block.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.780
So this is a different information that we have.

04:47.870 --> 04:52.600
Of course we have another option right there Magary to Segan duty.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.400
That's mean.

04:53.410 --> 04:54.670
Opportunities option is not available.

04:54.740 --> 05:01.380
Droguet a migration because no we are connected to the secondary want into the primary one complete

05:01.420 --> 05:04.480
immigration.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.180
So we have the option migrate.

05:06.180 --> 05:14.280
Secondly we can't power or power off or anything because the visual machine in immigration say is if

05:14.280 --> 05:20.460
we take this one is X I want still have a secondary one.

05:20.530 --> 05:27.590
I talk to one and the migration to integrate to primary one for all E-6 I do.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.190
Six by three.

05:30.190 --> 05:34.270
So let's just give it a little time and take the other option.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.890
So this is the option we have in the full term.

05:40.090 --> 05:46.900
Also if you have any information about the full list please share it with us in the discussion to let

05:46.900 --> 05:51.140
us know about its next section with another future.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.300
Off to the end with.
