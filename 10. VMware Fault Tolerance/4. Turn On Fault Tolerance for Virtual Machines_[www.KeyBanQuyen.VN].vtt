WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:02.490
Log in.

00:02.720 --> 00:08.640
So after covering the difference that we can get when we try to enable the full two wrongs.

00:08.810 --> 00:13.540
No we're going to enable default in our virtual machine.

00:13.690 --> 00:16.620
It is bolted on or even it is bolted up.

00:16.640 --> 00:17.760
It's not a problem.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.570
So we try to do it in about it's own virtual machine.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.950
So Windows XP number before headers it to Windows XP.

00:24.950 --> 00:27.340
Number four is potted on without any problem.

00:27.530 --> 00:29.860
Then we try to enable default.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.860
In this one.

00:31.130 --> 00:35.780
So we got a full so turn on for too long.

00:36.110 --> 00:37.580
So it's very simple.

00:37.730 --> 00:42.690
It's obscure to True's do that Astara you want to put this one inside.

00:42.920 --> 00:49.660
Of course it does look out that the store is not available to use a lock out at the store for the flatirons.

00:49.720 --> 00:56.750
If you check right hand it will give you there are not compatible current that are store selection of

00:56.890 --> 00:57.920
information right there.

00:57.950 --> 01:04.940
About six I want and is X Eitel is not supported by you using this lock out at the start.

01:05.030 --> 01:09.490
So the same for the second one but we chose our shared storage.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.900
It showed your compatible checked successfully.

01:12.110 --> 01:16.660
So logically this should not show up close to that.

01:16.700 --> 01:21.000
I don't know why you show them but actually they should be hidden.

01:21.050 --> 01:22.890
It only showed the shit.

01:23.120 --> 01:29.500
If we check this one of course if you remember a different file should be in our last one and Landru.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.440
This is about affinity.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.230
So we chose one or two.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.700
But before that let's try to check.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.810
So this one exists in the land too.

01:39.980 --> 01:48.710
If for example Charles Lund too it will work but it will give you Allard massage to know that this virtual

01:48.710 --> 01:53.050
machine and one will be in the same shared storage.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.900
And if you remember for the hearts of your ability to wait.

01:57.020 --> 02:04.790
If anything wrong happen to do shit it's trash the other shit it will be available to serve you a division

02:04.820 --> 02:05.400
machine.

02:05.540 --> 02:10.100
So if it was up if we chose to do compatibly cheek is exceed it.

02:10.190 --> 02:15.660
Click next as it's done with chick.

02:15.860 --> 02:20.460
I want that can't support this virtual machine.

02:20.590 --> 02:29.320
You see datastore learn to use it for both primary and secondary vim's disk which is not recommended.

02:29.470 --> 02:32.610
So what we do we click back and we chose lane 1.

02:32.620 --> 02:37.600
Of course you should have more shared storage to chose any one that you want.

02:37.900 --> 02:43.040
So we click NEXT there it show us it fix it 1.

02:43.080 --> 02:53.100
So another question that you will ask is why we only have 6 I want and not the Ituri.

02:53.130 --> 02:58.770
So the virtual machine that we want to enable default totals in it exist in is x.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.780
I took and I told you that you should never do falter in Essex.

03:04.860 --> 03:08.470
I want and I treat that's mean.

03:08.790 --> 03:12.690
Alda has to have full loss in.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.530
They should have available right there.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.880
But you said that we only have one ESX host.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.720
So the question is why.

03:21.930 --> 03:26.720
So if you remember the preview section you know the problem.

03:26.730 --> 03:27.530
What is it.

03:27.570 --> 03:30.350
So what do you think the problem is.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.970
Try to get your answer into discussion before complete this video.

03:35.070 --> 03:40.440
Click on the pause and give me your idea why we can't see it.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.760
I number the right hand.

03:42.870 --> 03:46.830
So take a moment and back to complete this lecture.

03:48.440 --> 03:55.010
OK so if you know the correct answer you have a good memory and you can remember what happened.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.400
DrÃ´le discourse.

03:56.550 --> 04:03.140
If not the problem right here is in distress rule.

04:03.210 --> 04:10.200
If you remember when we create some direct route we create our rule to do Windows XP.

04:10.200 --> 04:10.980
Number four.

04:11.040 --> 04:18.100
So let's back and check why we can't chose the Isak's I treat right here in the list.

04:18.210 --> 04:20.750
But Right-Hand so cancel this one.

04:20.910 --> 04:28.740
We've got to do cluster and in the config we go to the house rule and we check due to that we had the

04:28.740 --> 04:31.700
first one is this Debney you see right there is the.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.160
The second one is at the n on.

04:34.180 --> 04:38.640
Yes I agree and if we check this one we click it.

04:38.770 --> 04:47.490
You see that VM group want must not run on hosts in the group host group when we have must not.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.160
So what's its content.

04:49.200 --> 04:56.160
If we check right here we have this virtual machine must not run in Isak's tree no matter what happened.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.280
This virtual machine tool much ran in E6 number three.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.710
So if we check right here we have Win XP.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.470
Number four.

05:03.630 --> 05:07.290
So the virtual machine that we want to enable default runs.

05:07.350 --> 05:16.130
We have all the rules that say please do Windows XP but for should or must not be running into is X

05:16.200 --> 05:16.790
Ituri.

05:17.010 --> 05:21.850
That's why we don't have the choice to do it.

05:21.910 --> 05:28.680
Ideally So what we need to do because this is just too Tuireann of course in an environment you need

05:28.680 --> 05:30.000
to respect the rule.

05:30.180 --> 05:34.310
And of course you will have more i house to chose between them.

05:34.500 --> 05:42.660
So in our situation we go into design with this one or we simply delete the virtual machine number four

05:42.660 --> 05:45.140
from this rudes click Remove.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.970
Are you sure you want to remove the sexes.

05:48.190 --> 05:51.630
Man But yes so the virtual machine.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.710
No does not have any old rule about running ethics.

05:55.770 --> 05:59.880
I not pretty even this rule will still enable the virtual machine.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.020
Delegates from that group.

06:02.050 --> 06:04.150
So if we are back to the virtual machine.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.660
So no it exists into it.

06:06.680 --> 06:14.730
I do click for last then to say we chose lunch number one.

06:14.950 --> 06:17.140
This is the Rock'em on this one next.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.530
And no we have to use x.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.890
Host.

06:20.950 --> 06:25.360
So if you remember in the preview only have it I want.

06:25.450 --> 06:33.650
No we have it I want and Ituri of course more is available will show up right there and I your real

06:34.420 --> 06:34.860
estate.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.150
This is for the Master and this is for Ronnie.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.340
Hey no disconfirmation for the stadion.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.420
It's our configuration and chose which one should we muster.

06:43.420 --> 06:47.040
And the second one that will be soon into the primary and secondary.

06:47.260 --> 06:55.510
So if we chose for example is X a tree compatibly chicks see then which was do is X I want the compatibility

06:55.510 --> 06:57.000
Cheikh succeed.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.240
So we chose one of them we click next.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.290
Then here is a quick overview.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.340
The horrors that will have the secondary.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.490
So now we have to going to the end.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.190
The host will do it.

07:09.220 --> 07:16.930
I want the configuration file location ease into lane 1 tie breaker file location is lan 1 and 2 hard

07:16.930 --> 07:19.560
disk 1 location is block 1.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.440
If I remember into that option right.

07:22.980 --> 07:29.980
You have to chose any law that you want between the different land to save every file in a specific

07:29.980 --> 07:30.500
place.

07:32.760 --> 07:40.910
So like next next causing the trolls one next and click Finish.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.360
So no its start on default.

07:44.400 --> 07:50.370
In this virtual machine if we click on it it will stop changing the resource allocation for Windows

07:50.370 --> 07:56.520
XP and it will take a little time to complete the process because we'll try to mirror all the data of

07:56.520 --> 08:02.270
this imaging machine and the video must still work perfectly without any problem.

08:02.440 --> 08:09.540
Any tank still available for the user that use this image your machine and every tank will work perfectly

08:11.620 --> 08:19.780
so of course it will take a little time to complete the process by copying the top out of the virtual

08:19.780 --> 08:28.050
machine and do local disk and update and see if they an application exist in do local out hotties from

08:28.050 --> 08:29.450
not want to learn to.
