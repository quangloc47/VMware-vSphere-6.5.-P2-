WEBVTT

00:05.070 --> 00:08.200
So as you see it's work right.

00:08.200 --> 00:17.830
No of course I go and upgrade the resource of the Isak's I Haast want to know when we have this resource

00:17.830 --> 00:22.020
available for Ralls complete successfully.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.210
Very important state change it.

00:25.960 --> 00:34.430
So let's discover do you fall tunnel's information that we have of course let's wait until the fourth

00:34.540 --> 00:39.440
is complete succinctly and the virtual machine still work.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.700
We just need to refresh the console

00:58.710 --> 01:00.960
so let's read this information.

01:00.970 --> 01:10.170
Start fall too soon and that he can start full sig in the VM for Windows XP remote so he can do Windows

01:10.170 --> 01:13.780
XP for two primary on host is if I want.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.960
In Gloucester in Morocco.

01:16.080 --> 01:22.020
So it creates a signal that the virtual machine of the primary virtual machine in is x.

01:22.010 --> 01:25.620
I wonder if we check this what exists is X I want.

01:25.740 --> 01:33.780
So he creates two secondary one in another Isak's I when he complains you will get asked about it.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.620
Then full auto loans in Windows XP.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.210
Murray seeing Surin duty on it.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.110
I do it with encryption Magritte in Windows XP and before Pommery of Haast it I want.

01:45.150 --> 01:54.850
In Morocco so it's freezing a little because we consume all the resource of the host.

01:55.210 --> 01:59.940
But of course in that environment will have more resource to complete this process.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.300
The house the top two is X I want a D6.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.240
I too have an overloading in the CPI right.

02:08.240 --> 02:08.660
No.

02:08.780 --> 02:14.480
So the virtual machine starts freezing but it's still worked perfectly in the raid environment

02:18.090 --> 02:24.720
so it will take a little time to copy and past the data from the local disk of ADO Windows XP number

02:24.760 --> 02:36.310
4 from Landru to line 1.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.580
It's freezing.

02:37.580 --> 02:43.870
That's modularly because we use up smart environments only use my laptop for a lot.

02:44.030 --> 02:50.940
But of course in the real environment when you have more resource powerful C.P on the frame and speed

02:51.000 --> 02:56.580
hard over this task will go a little faster than you see right here.

02:57.200 --> 03:04.000
So what you see are exclamation mark right here virtual machine for put putting on state change it lets

03:04.230 --> 03:11.670
mean we changed a photo of this virtual machine.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.200
So I'm trying to check the resource of the laptop.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.830
The target is X I want and D6 I do.

03:17.870 --> 03:20.450
And also it's freezing.

03:20.540 --> 03:25.130
It's got to see to speed all to monitor the hard drive

03:28.740 --> 03:37.920
so into a hard drive I see that it cost you 100 percent of the speed of the driver and that's why we

03:37.920 --> 03:47.560
have our freezy moments in this windows that work in the same hard driver of laptop bits.

03:47.630 --> 03:52.830
Give it a little time and when the process complete back to you.

03:53.330 --> 03:58.980
So it's look like stop freezing like you see here or the virtual machine from displays.

03:59.120 --> 04:06.200
So the virtual machines still work perfectly and the process is complete successfully States state photo

04:06.420 --> 04:07.920
see can complete.

04:08.010 --> 04:15.320
Extremely so started full as you can do the M for Windows XP primary on host if I want.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.370
In cluster Morakot.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.680
So no we have our full throated enabled in this virtual machine.

04:22.680 --> 04:29.790
If you check the caller at Rite-Aid you see this between machine of a different icon than this other

04:29.790 --> 04:34.090
virtual machine and it's still bolted on without any problem.

04:34.110 --> 04:36.230
All do the tools still work.

04:36.360 --> 04:44.760
The Friesian was because we consume all the resource of the laptop that have E-6 I want it right.

04:44.940 --> 04:49.160
So next we'll discover more about this for $20.
