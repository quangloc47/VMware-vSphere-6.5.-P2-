WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:02.320
High.

00:02.520 --> 00:08.680
So let's try to enable default almost in our virtual lab.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.840
Of course in the real environment we'll be the same.

00:12.090 --> 00:18.360
So in this situation we want to enable the full response in our division is a whole that we want to

00:18.480 --> 00:27.670
use in the full service so that we go to every E6 I hold that we want to use it into full service that's

00:27.680 --> 00:28.370
mean we want.

00:28.410 --> 00:32.570
This is because I use it to by the rules we go to country.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.340
We've got to do the current.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.550
And we need to add or create a VM manful default.

00:39.720 --> 00:46.950
So of course if we have more network adapter available for the member physical adapter in this house

00:47.070 --> 00:49.090
we have a physical adapter.

00:49.290 --> 00:57.780
We use them all together into a difference of empowerment one for E6 I want one for is X I two and one

00:58.170 --> 01:01.710
for the Wii and one for the management network.

01:01.770 --> 01:06.340
Every VM can have two network adapter connect create four do.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.300
Height and ability.

01:07.320 --> 01:14.790
And for redundancy to avoid the losing and connection between the service and the different physical

01:14.850 --> 01:15.530
adapter.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.030
So we consume our physical either.

01:18.070 --> 01:24.560
But if we have another two three physical adapter it is a high Kamandi to carry it on your VM Karim

01:24.660 --> 01:25.650
like that.

01:25.650 --> 01:30.990
We chose VM kernel we click New were connected to the switches are all the same.

01:30.990 --> 01:37.550
Then we give it a name for example if the default is then we enable default.

01:37.620 --> 01:38.490
In this one.

01:38.760 --> 01:45.630
And of course we need to give it on IP and so on and so on then we need to connect it to a specific

01:45.690 --> 01:46.790
physical adapter.

01:46.890 --> 01:51.660
But as we dont have more physical adapter in this situation.

01:51.660 --> 01:58.680
So if you have a physical adapter available it is identical wanted to create a new VM colonel and connect

01:58.840 --> 02:03.670
atlast took physical adapter to do for me in general.

02:03.870 --> 02:12.510
If not and you want to use one of those VM kernel for the full two roles it is a little common Do not

02:12.900 --> 02:24.020
use do Flatirons we do or we do ice Kaze because rules will consume the network by transferring into

02:24.040 --> 02:28.440
data between two different hosts and a different vision machine.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.060
So we say that faulter an almost mirror or a virtual machine.

02:32.190 --> 02:38.900
But I mean when you saved Ah once you go right over the data into virtual machine Rimoldi So the filterless

02:38.910 --> 02:45.210
work as we have a primitive virtual machine and Ostergren the virtual machine double virtual machine

02:45.210 --> 02:46.310
work as a mirror.

02:46.320 --> 02:52.310
But one can't as pre-movie and the signal to one odds are secondary virtual machine.

02:52.530 --> 02:59.610
So when you walk or connect to the virtual machine directly and make your work you work on the virtual

02:59.610 --> 03:06.220
machine and if something happened to that primitive your machine default with robotics you directly

03:06.290 --> 03:09.380
to do virtual machine secondary.

03:09.720 --> 03:17.190
And in this situation when you save for example one gigabyte of the data in the primordial virtual machine

03:17.340 --> 03:21.780
you consumed a network between you and the virtual machine.

03:21.990 --> 03:30.570
Thats why we need at least 10 gigabytes of physical other to speed them the same time with the full

03:30.600 --> 03:38.010
details it could be that one gigabyte from the primary but your machine and tried to series in the secondary

03:38.100 --> 03:39.610
virtual machine.

03:39.690 --> 03:46.920
So the traffic is very high between the virtual machine and br1 and the signal to the virtual machine

03:47.040 --> 03:48.170
number one.

03:48.690 --> 03:54.840
So for us if we chose to use the physical adapter connected with the VM kernel that we use it for the

03:54.840 --> 04:02.790
new machine puts me in the same top physical adapter and the same cable will try to transfer it to that

04:02.820 --> 04:05.350
out of the four.

04:05.400 --> 04:12.520
But I mean the big data that we use in our virtual machine between duty and primitiveness your machine

04:12.960 --> 04:20.980
also is the same physical adapter for the Wii motion like storage of emotion and do stand out of the

04:21.010 --> 04:28.990
motion and thats a big data inside to physical network adapter so you will have a very slow network

04:29.020 --> 04:31.500
and some problem will start to happen.

04:31.510 --> 04:35.980
So for that it is always I want to not use the fault lines.

04:36.190 --> 04:39.010
We do the motion thats in the same vein.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.710
Kermit then the same for the cause.

04:42.780 --> 04:48.210
I it is the network adapter connected between the host and do the stars.

04:48.350 --> 04:56.040
So the data between the storage and DOS its very high its very big the size of the data is always big.

04:56.180 --> 05:03.530
So the same if you use the full performance traffic with the ICRC traffic you will have a slow network

05:03.590 --> 05:05.720
and some problems start to happen.

05:05.960 --> 05:13.460
So for that it is always I wanted to create two separate Physica network adapter specially for the full

05:13.630 --> 05:22.380
lines and more network adapter would be more good if in another case you don't have more physical network

05:22.380 --> 05:29.730
adapter and try to use some of the available data available in this situation is do management network

05:29.730 --> 05:36.760
because the management is what we do just only to connect between the user and do E6 I host.

05:36.810 --> 05:43.590
So in this situation we have low that transfer between the central server or to a user or administrator

05:43.920 --> 05:51.720
and do Isak's I use the VM Governors-General for the management so forth that will when to add the folder

05:51.770 --> 05:54.910
and also inside the VM canel zero.

05:55.410 --> 06:03.780
So if you have two physical adapter you can create one like that then next and next then you chose the

06:03.840 --> 06:07.520
full story and give it a name the next Its a drug.

06:07.610 --> 06:11.310
In another situation you dont have any available network adapter.

06:11.430 --> 06:15.680
You can simply click on the VM kernel 0 Hovda management network.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.490
So we have low traffic on this.

06:18.630 --> 06:25.040
The Inkerman we click he did and we simply enable do fault lines.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.920
Logging inside this one.

06:27.240 --> 06:31.450
So we have a situation a new one or an existing VM coming up.

06:31.470 --> 06:39.350
So we simply check this one and we click OK to enable do fault inside this once you see her enable its

06:39.350 --> 06:40.880
service full it on.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.460
And management.

06:42.540 --> 06:47.210
The other one have all the emotion and the one use it for the cause.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.570
So there are not service in this one.

06:49.890 --> 06:53.220
So the management have to fall to the last logging.

06:53.310 --> 06:56.630
So the same tank will going to do it in the difference is 6.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.850
I hope that we won't use it for the fault.

06:58.920 --> 07:08.820
So we got to do it because I am too then we got to do management enable if we check this one right here

07:08.820 --> 07:12.570
you see only have service enabled it is management.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.710
So we try to add a fourth.

07:15.010 --> 07:15.610
OK.

07:17.410 --> 07:21.670
So the configuration like that.

07:21.910 --> 07:31.100
So we have filtering all again then the same for E6 I hosts and so on and so on into other defaulters

07:31.150 --> 07:34.120
what difference is that you want to use.

07:34.120 --> 07:41.670
So for example if we enable the romance in E6 I want a D6 I talk when we try to enable default performance

07:41.740 --> 07:48.280
in a virtual machine that exist into asix I would do different option to chose is x I hope that you

07:48.280 --> 07:49.830
want to use for the four rows.

07:49.930 --> 07:57.970
It would be only E6 I too because that is a treat not enable it for the photo ops so it would not be

07:57.970 --> 08:01.990
available in the list of different fault or enhanced option.

08:01.990 --> 08:10.130
So after configuring three is I host or four or maybe 10 or out is what you want is what are for drones.

08:10.150 --> 08:15.690
Next we'll try to enable the faulter wants a delivery of virtual machine.

08:15.810 --> 08:16.860
See the next video.
