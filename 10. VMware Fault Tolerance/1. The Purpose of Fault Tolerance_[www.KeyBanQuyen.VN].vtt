00:01.690 --> 00:08.440
Hello and welcome again in this new section we're going to discover another future of the team with

00:09.560 --> 00:15.560
this future that we're going to discuss in the section is callet fold Totilas.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.330
So what is the fault.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.800
When we're going to talk about default rules.

00:22.070 --> 00:25.110
We need to talk a little about the heights of ability.

00:25.130 --> 00:31.970
If you remember in one of the previous sections we covered the height of obesity and we see the purpose

00:32.030 --> 00:37.560
of this to be a height of ability if you remember we had eat I.

00:37.790 --> 00:45.560
And when we achieved the heights of ability in our virtual machine in that host if something wrong happened

00:45.560 --> 00:51.650
to that host this virtual machine be out of service that's me in power.

00:52.070 --> 00:56.150
They do this fear that they try to reboot this virtual machine.

00:56.190 --> 01:04.700
In our modern hosts So all those tasks at the top and when this horse is out of service the machine

01:05.090 --> 01:06.980
rebooted in another host.

01:07.040 --> 01:17.190
We have our down time and in the raid environment the big enemy of NIIT manager is due down time.

01:17.360 --> 01:23.000
Any company will go into lost money when you have some down time.

01:23.030 --> 01:33.020
So for that all the company try to read down time try to get the maximum of the ability off their service

01:33.200 --> 01:34.870
their route et cetera.

01:35.390 --> 01:42.320
But industry when we use the height of ability when this virtual machine trick is done like this one

01:43.040 --> 01:49.250
it will take about 10 to 20 years to get that that's the biggest fear we know that the virtual machine.

01:49.330 --> 01:52.590
Indeed I will host is out of service.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.880
So we have about 20 seconds of downtime.

01:57.140 --> 02:06.260
Then do a try to reboot the virtual machine in another host and we'll take a time off the operating

02:06.260 --> 02:09.320
system need to complete to do its process.

02:09.390 --> 02:16.440
For example two or three minutes to complete loading of the operating system the application etc..

02:16.580 --> 02:21.020
So we have a downtime about three minutes.

02:21.020 --> 02:26.480
Also in another situation we have for example three virtual machine powerit of.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.930
So the fear of heights will try to power the first one that Hovda the highest priority.

02:32.060 --> 02:37.780
Then the second what they want if we have some votes order for this virtual machine.

02:37.940 --> 02:43.610
So the last one will take about five to 10 minutes to be available in our environment.

02:43.760 --> 02:50.590
So we have our down time and this is not a good think in a big company.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.480
So for that we have another service that its fault.

02:54.740 --> 03:00.230
So what is do for us or how the phone works.

03:00.230 --> 03:07.700
So the same we have to E6 I host of course when wrong is default but essence we need atlast.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.020
Joe E6 I host.

03:09.050 --> 03:12.360
We can't do the full two roles in one E-6 I host.

03:12.480 --> 03:18.990
Then we have a virtual machine inside that host that we're going to put it into for us.

03:19.130 --> 03:24.150
And when we enable default on in that's a virtual machine.

03:24.930 --> 03:32.930
At that moment defaulted arrays will try to clone this virtual machine as a mirror of it.

03:32.970 --> 03:39.000
So the virtual machine in this host is the same virtual machine in this house.

03:39.060 --> 03:47.570
The work at the same time and or work together with the same data and the same information.

03:47.670 --> 03:52.920
So it's like created a mirror virtual machine to the original one.

03:52.920 --> 03:59.430
When we enable do for us in this one the full details we will try to mirror this virtual machine inside

03:59.540 --> 04:01.540
another house.

04:01.680 --> 04:08.190
So we have two virtual machines that work out the same as one virtual machine.

04:08.190 --> 04:12.930
This one and this one have the same data the same read and write it down.

04:13.110 --> 04:18.280
So any user tried to update the data in this with your machine automatically updated.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.690
In this other virtual machine.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.910
So the two machine work together at the same time.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.430
So now we have two fold fold.

04:27.510 --> 04:31.060
So the benefits of the fall are not in this situation.

04:31.120 --> 04:35.260
I mean if something wrong happen to this E-6 I host.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.320
I mean this virtual machine will be out of service.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.370
We have another virtual machine that do the same thing.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.190
That's me.

04:43.350 --> 04:48.510
The user that connect to this vision machine when this virtual machine will service is automatically

04:48.780 --> 04:50.330
still connected to this one.

04:50.490 --> 04:56.680
And Duzer we're not going to fill any file or any down from dear side.

04:56.730 --> 05:02.760
He will keep in without any then Koppen from its own site.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.880
So in this situation we have zero downtime.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.630
If you remember the height of it was try to reboot to this one in this house.

05:09.810 --> 05:14.150
But no we already have the virtual machine bolted on and work perfectly.

05:14.190 --> 05:18.190
So the down time we'll take it is about zero.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.190
So this is the benefits of falls.

05:21.360 --> 05:21.750
Lance

05:24.760 --> 05:33.810
so kids are forced to read also have some requirements that need to be available to be used for it.

05:34.150 --> 05:42.910
That skali default maximum this that that computes for on this for 6.5 greed if you check this fear

05:42.920 --> 05:50.860
5:06 greedy you will find this information available and the condition to enable a full Torrijos in

05:50.860 --> 06:00.070
a virtual machine as this one the virtual disk in the virtual machine should not be more than 16 disk

06:00.830 --> 06:04.340
if you have more than 16 local disk.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.480
The fortress will not be available.

06:06.610 --> 06:10.530
The disk size should be less than 2 terabytes.

06:10.570 --> 06:18.130
If any virtual machine have our disk size more than two terabyte do for the rest we know to be available.

06:18.130 --> 06:24.180
Also some important information of course the virtual disk and size is not a problem in the right environment.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.380
All the virtual machine does not need more than 16 bits.

06:28.690 --> 06:33.040
Also the disk size always be less than 2 terabytes.

06:33.040 --> 06:38.930
It's probably when you fund the virtual machine have more than two terabytes only douceur the power

06:38.930 --> 06:39.510
base.

06:39.790 --> 06:44.540
Then we have the virtual C.P part virtual machine.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.900
The maximum is for spew.

06:46.960 --> 06:53.790
If you create a virtual machine with more than 4 speed this virtual machine we're not going to work

06:53.790 --> 06:55.350
with the forth.

06:55.900 --> 07:03.940
Also if you carry it on RAM for the virtual machine more than 64 gigabytes this machine will not be

07:04.000 --> 07:05.980
available for default.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.960
So the maximum is 64 gigabytes of run for c.p.

07:10.990 --> 07:17.970
Also I'm not the rule is how much virtual machine can exist or can be run it in a host.

07:18.010 --> 07:21.490
The maximum is for virtual machine potholes.

07:21.520 --> 07:29.050
If you create an is X eyeholes and create five virtual machine you can't enable the filterless for the

07:29.050 --> 07:32.120
five virtual machine the Marksman is for.

07:32.140 --> 07:40.460
Also the virtual city of potholes is eight the requirement that you can't do it without having this

07:40.460 --> 07:46.400
requirement is to have 10 gigabyte ethernet network adapter.

07:46.520 --> 07:52.370
The speed of our network adapter will be changing gobshites because the data will be read in the double

07:52.530 --> 07:54.470
placed division.

07:54.650 --> 07:56.510
We work from the double Isak's.

07:56.510 --> 08:02.900
I hope the connection will be faster to avoid that slow down time between the difference between machine

08:03.230 --> 08:05.640
and also you need a license of the 4.

08:05.660 --> 08:11.980
But it alas when you buy out the center server you need to buy delices that contains the fault.

08:12.120 --> 08:19.840
Lost any tool all of them were have it our lessons do entreprise license have all those future available.

08:20.060 --> 08:25.470
And of course we use tree elevation that give us our future for free.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.890
Or the 16 banks.

08:27.950 --> 08:32.020
So next we'll try to work in the real environment so see the next.
